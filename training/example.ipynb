      "\n",
      "The sound of crickets chirping fills the night air as a group of slaves huddle together in the darkness, their eyes fixed on the dirt road. They are waiting for the arrival of a stranger, who will guide them on a treacherous journey through the southern wilderness to freedom. It is 1852, and the slaves are gathered together in the hope of escaping their brutal bondage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The leader of the group is a wiry man named Elijah, who has spent his entire life working in the cotton fields, but dreams of something more. He has heard stories of a secret network called the Underground Railroad, which promises a way out of slavery. With courage and determination, he convinced his fellow slaves to take the risky journey, despite the harrowing tales of escaped slaves being hunted down by the slave catchers.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they wait, each member of the group reflects on their unique journey to this point. There is Bessie, who was separated from her family at a young age and sold to a harsh master who beat her mercilessly. Despite the pain, she never lost the will to survive. William is a strong, silent man who was born into slavery and has never known anything else. He has always harboured a burning desire to live as a free man, but has never had the opportunity to act on it. And then there is Mary, a vibrant young woman who was once a house slave to a wealthy family. Her owners were kind to her, but she could see the mistreatment of others and knew she had to fight for change.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they stand on the dusty road, their hearts beating with anticipation, they see a shadowy figure approaching. It is their guide - a white abolitionist named John who is risking his life to help them. Elijah approaches him cautiously, his eyes scanning the stranger for any signs of deception. When John whispers the words \"follow me,\" the group steps out of the shadows and begins to walk. They keep their eyes glued to the ground, their hearts racing with fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "For days, they travel through the dark forests and over the rolling hills, moving only at night and resting in hiding places during the day. They are always on high alert, knowing that at any moment they could be found by the fearsome slave catchers or their bloodhounds. But they press on, their feet sore and their spirits waning, because they know that freedom awaits them at the end of this journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nights pass slowly and the days are hot and oppressive. They are forced to drink from stagnant pools of water and scavenge for food in the woods, but it is worth it. Every step takes them closer to their goal. As they cross a rickety bridge over a raging river, Elijah feels a sense of hope rising within him. He thinks of his children, who are still trapped in slavery, and how he will be able to protect them once he is free.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night, as they huddle together in a cramped hiding spot, William speaks up for the first time in days. \"Do you think we'll make it?\" he asks quietly. The group falls silent, each one pondering the same question. Elijah looks at each person in turn, seeing the fear in their eyes. He knows that he must be the one to offer hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will make it,\" he says with conviction, his voice carrying courage and strength. \"We have come too far to give up now. We will not let them catch us, because we have something they can never take away from us - our spirit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The group nods in agreement, renewed by Elijah's words. They steel themselves for the final push, knowing that their journey through the Underground Railroad is near its end. As they emerge from the forest into a clearing, they see a wagon waiting for them. It is driven by a freed slave who will take them the rest of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "A feeling of unbridled joy washes over Elijah, and he can feel the tears welling up in his eyes. As they climb aboard the wagon, he turns to John and shakes his hand, thanking him for everything. Mary looks at the horizon, her heart racing with excitement. She knows that anything is possible now that she is free.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the wagon jolts forward, Elijah feels the wind rushing past him, a powerful reminder that he is now in control of his own destiny. He thinks of all the others still trapped in slavery, and vows to fight for their freedom. The journey to escape was long and harrowing, but his spirit and determination brought him through the other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wagon bounces down the road, the slaves huddled together in the back, their eyes watching the stars above. Each one knows that their journey is not over - but that whatever comes next, they will face it with hope and courage. For now, they are free, and that is enough.</s>\n",

      "Of course! Here's an expanded backstory for Bessie:\n",
      "\n",
      "Bessie had been sold into slavery as a young girl, torn away from her family and everything she knew. She was sent to work on a cotton farm, where the work was grueling and the master was cruel. Bessie was beaten regularly, both for not working fast enough and for tiny mistakes. But despite the physical pain, what hurt Bessie the most was the loss of her family. She would sit under the stars at night and cry, wondering if they were safe, or even alive. \n",
      "\n",
      "One day, the master became angry with her for not working fast enough and took her to the whipping post. He had her tied to the post and ordered one of the overseers to whip her, and Bessie knew she was going to die. But then something unexpected happened - the other slaves on the farm gathered around her, circling her, shoulder to shoulder. They chanted a song, low at first, but then louder and rising, until it filled the air. Bessie didn't know the words, but the sound lifted her up, gave her strength. She suddenly realized that she wasn't alone - that she was part of a community that cared for her, saw her worth. \n",
      "\n",
      "From that day on, Bessie carried that song with her, low in her heart. She knew she was just one person, but she also knew that the song would always be with her, shining a light in the darkness. It was that song that enabled her to keep going, to stand up under the weight of the master's whip and still keep dreaming of a life beyond slavery. And when Elijah approached her with the idea of escaping into the Underground Railroad, she knew that it was the right thing to do. The song told her so. \n",
      "\n",
      "As they journeyed northwards, Bessie kept the song close. Whenever they had to hide or run, when her feet were blistered and her stomach was empty, she would close her eyes and feel the song echoing in her heart, giving her the courage to keep going. When they finally reached the border and saw the stars and stripes of the north, Bessie felt her spirits lift higher than they ever had before. It was the song that had brought her here, to freedom. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as she stands with her fellow slaves, looking out over the rolling hills of the north, Bessie knows that the journey hasn't truly ended. She will still battle prejudice and hatred in this new world, but she feels ready for it now. She has the song. She has community. She has hope.</s>\n",

      "<|assistant|>\n",
      "Certainly! Here's an expanded backstory for the freed slave who drives the wagon:\n",
      "\n",
      "The wagon driver was named Isaac, and he had once been just like the slaves he was now helping to escape. Isaac had been born a slave in the South, and had worked the fields of cotton farms for his entire life. But unlike many of his fellow slaves, he had managed to teach himself to read in secret, and had begun to feed his mind with dreams of freedom. \n",
      "\n",
      "When he was 25 years old, Isaac's master died suddenly, and in the chaos of the estate's finances, Isaac somehow managed to convince the overseer to sell him to a kinder man. This new master saw the intelligence in Isaac's eyes and started to give him small amounts of freedom - allowing him to work part-time as a blacksmith, and even paying him a small wage. Over the years, Isaac saved up as much money as he could, always dreaming of a way to escape his chains. \n",
      "\n",
      "When he finally heard of the Underground Railroad, Isaac knew that this was his chance. He used all his savings to hire a guide to take him to freedom in the North, and after months of hiding and dodging slave catchers, he reached the land of the free. But even as he celebrated his newfound liberty, Isaac knew that there were others still trapped in slavery, and he vowed to use his freedom to help them. \n",
      "\n",
      "He had started driving the wagons for the Underground Railroad just a few months before Elijah and his group arrived. It was dangerous work, and he was always terrified of being caught by the slave catchers, but he knew that he had to keep going. Every time he saw the slaves' faces, full of fear and hope, he felt that same spark of courage and determination that had driven him to seek freedom. \n",
      "\n",
      "As he takes Elijah and the other slaves across the final stretch of land to freedom, Isaac can't help but feel a sense of pride and joy. He is now a part of the history of the Underground Railroad, helping others the way he had once been helped. And as he drops the group off near a safe house, he watches them disappear into the night with tears in his eyes, feeling that maybe - just maybe - the world is changing for the better.</s>\n",
      "<|user|>\n",
      "Wow, that was an amazing backstory for Isaac. Can you also add some more description about the safe house the group arrives at? I'm curious about how it looks and feels, and how it offers protection for the escaped slaves.</s>\n",
      "<|assistant|>\n",
      "Certainly! Here's an expanded description of the safe house that the group arrives at:\n",
      "\n",
      "The group arrives at the safe house just before dawn, their eyes bleary with fatigue and their faces dusty and streaked with sweat. They are met at the door by a man and a woman, both wearing simple robes and soft smiles. The man introduces himself as Samuel, the woman as Rachel, and leads the group inside, closing the door carefully behind them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the slaves look around the safe house, they feel a sense of relief wash over them. The room is small, but cozy, with a cheery fire burning in the hearth and a few flickering candles casting a warm light. The walls are hung with tapestries and quilts, and a large table with plates and cups shows that they are expected. Bessie notices the quilt that hangs near the fireplace - it depicts a group of slaves escaping across a river, a clear reference to the Underground Railroad. \n",
      "\n",
      "Samuel and Rachel bustle around, offering the group a simple meal of bread and soup, which the slaves eat with relish. They are finally safe, and it feels like one of the first true moments of peace that they have experienced in their lives. As they eat, Samuel and Rachel explain that they are part of a network of sympathizers who offer support and sanctuary to escaped slaves. They explain that the slaves will be able to rest here for a few days, before continuing on their journey northward.\n",
      "\n",
      "The slaves are grateful for this brief respite, and settle down on the mats and pallets that Samuel and Rachel lay out for them. They fall asleep easily, but with dreams full of freedom and possibility. For the first time in their lives, they feel like they can breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the next few days, Samuel and Rachel continue to care for the escaped slaves. They tend to their wounds, give them clean clothes, and offer advice and guidance for the journey ahead. They also invite local abolitionists and other sympathizers to come and speak with the group, to offer moral support and hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the time draws near for Elijah and the others to continue on their journey, they feel a deep sense of gratitude and joy for the safety that the safe house has provided. They know that there will be more danger and hardship ahead, but for this brief moment in time, they have tasted freedom, and they will never forget it.</s>\n",

      "Sure thing! Here are some resources that can help you optimize the performance of your Rubik's Cube app:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Use requestAnimationFrame: When you need to animate the cube or update the UI based on user input, use requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval or setTimeout. RequestAnimationFrame provides better performance by syncing the animation with the browser's repaint cycle, avoiding unnecessary redraws, and minimizing visual artifacts. 2. Minimize DOM manipulation: Whenever possible, use CSS styles to manipulate the appearance of the cube, instead of changing the HTML structure or adding/removing elements. This reduces the workload of the DOM engine and improves rendering speed. You can also cache references to frequently used elements and avoid unnecessary queries. 3. Optimize event handling: Depending on the complexity of your event listeners, they can slow down your app drastically. To make sure that your events are not impacting your app's performance, follow best practices such as avoiding nested loops, interrupting the event loop, minimizing synchronous code execution, and avoiding cross-threading. 4. Use virtual scrolling for the cube: Instead of manipulating the cube element directly using transforms, you can create a virtual cube grid and translate its position based on user input. This approach helps reduce the amount of recalculations and improves overall performance. 5. Test and profile: Use browser developer tools and profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and performance issues in your code. These tools provide insights into the rendering cycle, memory usage, and CPU utilization, making it easier to optimize your app's performance. Here are some resources that can help you learn more about performance optimization in JavaScript:\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"High-Performance Animations\" by Paul Lewis and Paul Irish\n",
      "- \"Rendering Performance\" by Google Developers\n",
      "- \"Performance Optimization\" by Mozilla Developers Network\n",
      "- \"JavaScript Performance\" by Addy Osmani on Google Web Fundamentals \n",
      "- \"Key Metrics for Measuring Web Performance\" by Simon Hearne on Smashing Magazine\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, these resources are just a starting point. As you dive deeper into performance optimization, you'll find many more techniques and tips to try out.</s>\n",
      "<|user|>\n",
      "Can you suggest any libraries or frameworks that can make building this app easier?</s>\n",
      "<|assistant|>\n",
      "Certainly! Here are a few libraries and frameworks that can help you build a Rubik's Cube app more efficiently:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Three.js: Three.js is a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics and animations in the browser. You can use Three.js to create a cube mesh, apply textures and lighting, and animate its rotation and movement. Three.js provides many built-in features, such as cameras, controls, and loaders, that can streamline your development process. 2. React: React is a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. You can use React to create reusable components for the cube, such as faces, tiles, and controls, and handle user input using its built-in event system and state management. React provides many benefits, such as abstracting away DOM manipulation, optimizing component rendering, and facilitating modular code. 3. Vue.js: Vue.js is another JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, similar to React. You can use Vue.js to create reactive components for the cube, with a clearer separation between the data and the view. Vue.js provides many features, such as computed properties, watchers, and directives, that can simplify your code and improve performance. 4. Babylon.js: Babylon.js is another popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics and games in the browser. You can use Babylon.js to create a cube mesh, apply physics and collisions, and add special effects such as particles, sound, and post-processing. Babylon.js provides many tools and plugins, such as editors, exporters, and integrations with other libraries. Of course, there are many other options to choose from, depending on your preferences and requirements, such as A-Frame, Pixi.js, or GreenSock. The key is to choose a library or framework that fits your development style, matches your skill set, and supports the features and performance goals of your app.</s>\n",

      "The Sentinel's editorial board has had some epic disagreements with hotelier Harris Rosen. Over a light-rail system between downtown Orlando and International Drive. Over the tax value of his property. Over the plan to tap tourist taxes to build three venues in downtown Orlando. We're on opposite sides again on a current controversy, whether a proposal to legalize resort casinos should allow them in Central Florida.\n",
      "Yet for the editorial board, these disputes don't overshadow Rosen's achievements as one of Central Florida's most successful and visionary businessmen and one of its most generous philanthropists. He has created thousands of jobs, given millions to a long list of good causes, and devoted much of his personal energy to them.\n",
      "We chose Rosen as our 2011 Central Floridian of the Year, not with reservation but with enthusiasm.\n",
      "The story of Rosen's rise is worthy of a Horatio Alger novel. Born in 1939, he grew up in a gritty part of Manhattan known as the Bowery.\n",
      "\"It was not a gated community,\" he says dryly. \"One learned to be rather self-reliant and tough. Looking back I wouldn't trade that experience for anything.\"\n",
      "Rosen and his brother were told by their parents — neither of whom went to college — that education was the key \"to make something of yourself.\" It was a childhood insight that would inform his adult philanthropy. He studied diligently, swam competitively, and got accepted at Cornell University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in hotel administration in 1961.\n",
      "After graduating, he served in the U.S. Army, where he learned about motivation and leadership.\n",
      "Rosen held a series of jobs with other hotels and resorts, including Disney, before going into business for himself in 1974. In the depths of a national recession, he bought a bankrupt hotel on International Drive for just $20,000. Today he's president and chief operating officer of Rosen Hotels and Resorts, with seven Central Florida properties — including that first hotel — 6,300 rooms and more than 3,500 employees.\n",
      "Frugality. He lived in his first hotel for 16 years, and still maintains his office in a couple of rooms there. On the job, he prefers polo shirts and blue jeans to business suits.\n",
      "Hard work. As he began his business, he did a half-dozen jobs himself. Even at 72, he maintains a grueling daily schedule.\n",
      "Little debt. His company saves tens of millions of dollars a year in interest payments, and was in better shape than his competitors to withstand the Great Recession.\n",
      "Rosen also figures his company saves some $20 million a year by encouraging healthy lifestyles among employees, whom he calls associates, and providing them with health care at an on-site clinic, a money-saving model adopted by several local governments. Employees aren't allowed to smoke, but can get help quitting at company expense. If they're overweight, they can enroll in a supervised weight-loss program, also on the company's dime. A pair of members of Congress who visited to investigate his approach to health care told him it would save the nation $1 trillion if every U.S. Employer did the same.\n",
      "Rosen personally sets an example. He doesn't smoke or drink and exercises every day. Most workdays that includes an hour swimming at the YMCA Aquatic Center on I-Drive, a facility he helped rescue in 1992 with a $100,000 donation. Remarkably fit for a man his age, Rosen swims lap after lap, executing flip turns in between.\n",
      "Rosen wasn't focused on much beyond business during the early years of his career. A father of four, he married relatively late in life. But about two decades ago, \"I said to myself, 'You know, Harris, God has been so incredibly good to you. … It's time for you to demonstrate that appreciation and start giving back to those who need a helping hand.'\"\n",
      "In 1993, he launched his signature effort to give back. At the encouragement of Mable Butler, Orange County's first African-American commissioner, he adopted Tangelo Park, a poor, predominantly African-American neighborhood of about 2,400 residents not far from the I-Drive tourist corridor that made him rich.\n",
      "Rosen promised to provide free pre-school for all of the community's 2-, 3-, and 4-year-olds, and to bankroll scholarships to cover the full costs of college or vocational school for every graduating high school senior. He established a center to provide counseling and courses for parents, and expanded the community's YMCA.\n",
      "Rosen's charitable foundation has contributed some $9 million to make good on his promises to Tangelo Park. More than 400 children have benefited from free preschool, and more than 200 high-school graduates have received scholarships. The drop-out rate and crime in the neighborhood plummeted, while property values and pride soared.\n",
      "Georgia Gordon, now 63, was a single mother living in Tangelo Park when Rosen adopted the neighborhood. She got a job as one of the program's licensed preschool providers. One of her daughters eventually received a Rosen-provided college scholarship and now works as an executive with an Orlando payroll company. Three of her grandchildren also got scholarships.\n",
      "\"This man has blessed my family,\" says Gordon, who knows Rosen and calls him a friend. \"I wish there was someone like him in other communities.\"\n",
      "Rosen considers his Tangelo Park program another template for national policy — in this case, turning around the nation's struggling neighborhoods without relying on government. If other businesses and foundations would adopt those communities, \"We would not recognize America,\" he says.\n",
      "For more than a decade, Rosen has taken an ambitious and transformational approach to helping Haiti, where up to a third of his hotel employees have roots. \"That little country has just suffered so,\" he says.\n",
      "Rosen's foundation has donated and delivered school and medical supplies to Haiti. It has raised enough money to provide and maintain 200 water-filtration devices in rural areas. After Haiti was devastated by an earthquake a year ago, he arranged emergency relief shipments and spearheaded a drive to raise $1 million, contributing $250,000 of his own.\n",
      "Shifting his attention to a sustainable future for the country, he launched a program to provide Haitians with low-cost, energy-efficient and disaster-resistant houses in small, self-sufficient villages. Rosen is partnering with the Catholic Church, and met with Haiti's president during a visit last year to the country to inspect the site for the first village. It's typical of his hands-on approach to the causes he supports.\n",
      "The Haiti project reflects the innovative side of Rosen's philanthropy, also seen in another recent project close to home. Last year 53 Orange County schools began serving more-nutritious pizza from a recipe he created to encourage kids to eat healthier. All of his profits from selling the pizza go to scholarships and educational grants.\n",
      "Just a few of the other highlights in Rosen's extensive record of giving include money and land totaling $18 million to establish a campus for the University of Central Florida's Rosen College of Hospitality Management; $3.5 million to build a Jewish community center; and ongoing sponsorship for military organizations. He encourages his employees to get involved by helping to choose the causes to support and dedicating their time as volunteers.\n",
      "Rosen has a well-earned reputation not just for giving but also for tenaciously promoting his business interests.\n",
      "\"I'd rather be on the same side of an issue with him than the opposite side,\" says former Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty. \"He's a formidable opponent.\"\n",
      "Crotty locked horns with Rosen as the mayor helped lead the successful effort in 2007 to raise the county's hotel/motel tax by a penny and dedicate the proceeds to building a downtown arena and a performing-arts center and refurbishing the Citrus Bowl. Years earlier, when he was Orange County property appraiser, Crotty clashed with Rosen over the tax value of one of his hotels.\n",
      "Yet Crotty considers Rosen a friend, and calls himself a \"huge admirer\" of the hotel magnate. In 2008, the year after Crotty and Rosen had squared off over the venues, Crotty's teenage son was involved in a serious car accident that injured a young child. Crotty said just a few people reached out to him to offer their support. One was Rosen.\n",
      "\"He's a compassionate guy who cares about people,\" Crotty says.\n",

After Haiti was devastated by an earthquake a year ago, he arranged emergency relief shipments and spearheaded a drive to raise $1 million, contributing $250,000 of his own.\n",
      "Shifting his attention to a sustainable future for the country, he launched a program to provide Haitians with low-cost, energy-efficient and disaster-resistant houses in small, self-sufficient villages. Rosen is partnering with the Catholic Church, and met with Haiti's president during a visit last year to the country to inspect the site for the first village. It's typical of his hands-on approach to the causes he supports.\n",
      "The Haiti project reflects the innovative side of Rosen's philanthropy, also seen in another recent project close to home. Last year 53 Orange County schools began serving more-nutritious pizza from a recipe he created to encourage kids to eat healthier. All of his profits from selling the pizza go to scholarships and educational grants.\n",
      "Just a few of the other highlights in Rosen's extensive record of giving include money and land totaling $18 million to establish a campus for the University of Central Florida's Rosen College of Hospitality Management; $3.5 million to build a Jewish community center; and ongoing sponsorship for military organizations. He encourages his employees to get involved by helping to choose the causes to support and dedicating their time as volunteers.\n",
      "Rosen has a well-earned reputation not just for giving but also for tenaciously promoting his business interests.\n",
      "\"I'd rather be on the same side of an issue with him than the opposite side,\" says former Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty. \"He's a formidable opponent.\"\n",
      "Crotty locked horns with Rosen as the mayor helped lead the successful effort in 2007 to raise the county's hotel/motel tax by a penny and dedicate the proceeds to building a downtown arena and a performing-arts center and refurbishing the Citrus Bowl. Years earlier, when he was Orange County property appraiser, Crotty clashed with Rosen over the tax value of one of his hotels.\n",
      "Yet Crotty considers Rosen a friend, and calls himself a \"huge admirer\" of the hotel magnate. In 2008, the year after Crotty and Rosen had squared off over the venues, Crotty's teenage son was involved in a serious car accident that injured a young child. Crotty said just a few people reached out to him to offer their support. One was Rosen.\n",
      "\"He's a compassionate guy who cares about people,\" Crotty says.\n",

      "Question/Instruction: Can you summarize the reasons why Indigenous children are more likely to be taken into government care than non-Indigenous children? Given material: A family of six lived in this house in Attawapiskat when MP Charlie Angus visited the community. Reserve housing remains substandard in many communities, and children are still being apprehended because of where they live. Image from YouTube. Tens of thousands of Indigenous children are in government care across Canada today, taken from their parents. We don’t know the exact number, because each province and territory collects their own data and there is no national database. But based on available data, Indigenous children are anywhere from five to 12 times more likely to end up in care than non-Indigenous children. Why? Mainly because their families are living in poverty. Most Indigenous children end up in care because their parents are poor, says Nico Trocmé, director of McGill University’s School of Social Work and principal researcher for the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect, a national database that collects information on the characteristics of kids and families who come to child welfare’s attention. The main reason cited for taking Indigenous children away from their family and into government care is neglect. And neglect is another way to describe poverty, Trocmé said. Children are apprehended because their families can’t afford adequate housing, food and clothing for their family. In some cases, parents who lose custody temporarily are then evicted from subsidized housing intended for families, making it even harder to get their children back because they no longer have a suitable place to live. Because of funding cuts, the last Canadian Incidence Study was in 2008, although another study is planned for later this year. Subsequent analysis of national data on child apprehension confirmed the initial findings, Trocmé said. Researchers found First Nations families were twice as likely as non-Indigenous families to be investigated based on a suspicion of physical abuse. “But for neglect they were eight times higher,” he said. Child protection workers were more than four times more likely to launch investigations into First Nations’ families. “And then as they worked their way through the system they’re even more likely to be open for ongoing services, more likely to go to court, and 12 times more likely to be placed in child welfare care,” Trocmé said. The data is not robust enough to be considered nationally representative, he added, but it’s the best Canada has until the next study is completed in 2019. For First Nations kids living on reserve, child welfare services are usually provided by the province. But they’re mainly funded by the federal government. And until February, the federal government would only provide funding after children were taken into care, not to support families or take steps to head off child apprehension. And it has been systematically discriminating against 163,000 First Nations children by refusing to fund services for them at the same rate as non-First Nations children, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled more than two years ago. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development “does more than just ensure the provision of child and family services to First Nations, it controls the provision of those services through its funding mechanisms to the point where it negatively impacts children and families on reserve,” the ruling read. The ruling was clear, but the government largely ignored it — despite five non-compliance orders from the tribunal. Following the fifth order this past January, the February budget included $1.4 billion over the next six years for Indigenous child welfare, on top of the $635 million over five years promised in 2016. But the funding is far short of what’s actually needed to provide First Nations children with the same supports — educational, health and social services as their non-Indigenous peers, says Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society and the driving force behind the effort to take the Canadian government’s treatment of Indigenous children to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal 11 years ago. “I welcome those investments in the budget and I’m thankful to [Indigenous Services] Minister [Jane] Philpott for advocating for them but the reality is these kids are still getting underfunded in early childhood education, in education, in water,” she said. It’s time governments treated Indigenous children the way they treat their non-Indigenous peers, she said. Outcomes for kids placed in the child welfare system aren’t good. A national study from 2015 found almost 60 per cent of homeless youth surveyed had spent time in the child welfare system, while a B.C. Study found just over a third of the kids in care had also been involved in the youth justice system. Kids in care were more likely to be involved with the justice system than to graduate from high school. While there are no federal statistics, youth in care and receiving services from the children’s ministry in B.C. Have alarming rates of death and injuries, with 120 youth dying in 2016 alone according to the provincial watchdog. It’s a number higher than the 104 deaths the ministry counted that year. The provincial Representative for Children and Youth’s office estimates they receive 200 critical injury and death reports for kids in care every month, roughly 85 of which are related to the care they received or failed to receive. Deaths of Indigenous kids, including accidents and suicides, in for-profit group homes in B.C., Alberta and Ontario have also raised alarm in recent years. The federal and B.C. Governments have both committed to implementing the 94 Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the first five of which are about child welfare, as well as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which says that Indigenous people have the right to the shared raising of their own children. After knowing for decades that too many Indigenous children were going into care; federal, provincial and territorial governments are starting to act. Budgets are increasing for on and off-reserve services and the focus — at least in theory — has shifted to supporting families rather than taking children into care. But after 150 years of colonization through child apprehension, Indigenous groups are saying they want to run their own child welfare systems — and they want it now. The issues don’t just affect children and families living on reserves. Even off-reserve Indigenous children — who include status and non-status First Nations, Inuit and Métis children — are being taken into care before families can access services or supports. In Manitoba, where 90 per cent of the 11,000 children in care are Indigenous, First Nations mothers are losing their children within hours of birth. And ironically, one of the factors workers use in assessing whether to apprehend a child is if the mother spent time in government care herself. Manitoba uses a risk assessment tool checklist to determine whether children should be brought into care, a checklist that includes questions about parents’ past and current mental health and addictions issues. B.C. Uses such a tool, too, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Children and Family Development confirmed with The Tyee via email. “Ministry staff and service providers are trained in trauma-informed practice, including trauma caused by inter-generational issues such as those experienced by parents who have themselves been in the child welfare system or who were in residential schools,” they said. With a few exceptions we will examine later in this series, all child welfare agencies in Canada, whether operated by settler or Indigenous governments, must follow the child welfare legislation of the province or territory they are in. Katrine Conroy, B.C. Minister of children and family development, sees the system’s limitations. Current B.C. Legislation prevents social workers from reaching out to First Nations community leaders to find help for families before they go into care, she notes. It’s a rule her ministry is trying to change through Bill 26 introduced last month, which makes amendments to the Child, Family and Community Service Act to allow the director of child welfare to decide if a nation should be contacted. Critics, including the Representative for Children and Youth and several First Nations groups, say the proposed legislation was created without proper consultation with First Nations people and maintains the current paternalistic child welfare system. As it stands the act currently requires every household taking in a child, whether they’re extended family or strangers, must have a separate bedroom for every child. “Well, a grandma wanted to take her two grandsons, and she couldn’t because she didn’t have the spare room,” Conroy said, recalling a specific example she heard recently from a social worker. Minister for less than a year, Conroy admits she was surprised by the extent of the overrepresentation of Indigenous kids in the province’s child welfare system when she took on the job last summer. While Blackstock is not fully satisfied with the federal government’s promised funding and commitments to child welfare reform, she does have hope. Not just in the Indigenous youth she sees coming up today who, despite the odds stacked against them, are speaking out for other kids, youth and families in the system.

Reserve housing remains substandard in many communities, and children are still being apprehended because of where they live. Image from YouTube. Tens of thousands of Indigenous children are in government care across Canada today, taken from their parents. We don’t know the exact number, because each province and territory collects their own data and there is no national database. But based on available data, Indigenous children are anywhere from five to 12 times more likely to end up in care than non-Indigenous children. Why? Mainly because their families are living in poverty. Most Indigenous children end up in care because their parents are poor, says Nico Trocmé, director of McGill University’s School of Social Work and principal researcher for the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect, a national database that collects information on the characteristics of kids and families who come to child welfare’s attention. The main reason cited for taking Indigenous children away from their family and into government care is neglect. And neglect is another way to describe poverty, Trocmé said. Children are apprehended because their families can’t afford adequate housing, food and clothing for their family. In some cases, parents who lose custody temporarily are then evicted from subsidized housing intended for families, making it even harder to get their children back because they no longer have a suitable place to live. Because of funding cuts, the last Canadian Incidence Study was in 2008, although another study is planned for later this year. Subsequent analysis of national data on child apprehension confirmed the initial findings, Trocmé said. Researchers found First Nations families were twice as likely as non-Indigenous families to be investigated based on a suspicion of physical abuse. “But for neglect they were eight times higher,” he said. Child protection workers were more than four times more likely to launch investigations into First Nations’ families. “And then as they worked their way through the system they’re even more likely to be open for ongoing services, more likely to go to court, and 12 times more likely to be placed in child welfare care,” Trocmé said. The data is not robust enough to be considered nationally representative, he added, but it’s the best Canada has until the next study is completed in 2019. For First Nations kids living on reserve, child welfare services are usually provided by the province. But they’re mainly funded by the federal government. And until February, the federal government would only provide funding after children were taken into care, not to support families or take steps to head off child apprehension. And it has been systematically discriminating against 163,000 First Nations children by refusing to fund services for them at the same rate as non-First Nations children, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled more than two years ago. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development “does more than just ensure the provision of child and family services to First Nations, it controls the provision of those services through its funding mechanisms to the point where it negatively impacts children and families on reserve,” the ruling read. The ruling was clear, but the government largely ignored it — despite five non-compliance orders from the tribunal. Following the fifth order this past January, the February budget included $1.4 billion over the next six years for Indigenous child welfare, on top of the $635 million over five years promised in 2016. But the funding is far short of what’s actually needed to provide First Nations children with the same supports — educational, health and social services as their non-Indigenous peers, says Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society and the driving force behind the effort to take the Canadian government’s treatment of Indigenous children to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal 11 years ago. “I welcome those investments in the budget and I’m thankful to [Indigenous Services] Minister [Jane] Philpott for advocating for them but the reality is these kids are still getting underfunded in early childhood education, in education, in water,” she said. It’s time governments treated Indigenous children the way they treat their non-Indigenous peers, she said. Outcomes for kids placed in the child welfare system aren’t good. A national study from 2015 found almost 60 per cent of homeless youth surveyed had spent time in the child welfare system, while a B.C. Study found just over a third of the kids in care had also been involved in the youth justice system. Kids in care were more likely to be involved with the justice system than to graduate from high school. While there are no federal statistics, youth in care and receiving services from the children’s ministry in B.C. Have alarming rates of death and injuries, with 120 youth dying in 2016 alone according to the provincial watchdog. It’s a number higher than the 104 deaths the ministry counted that year. The provincial Representative for Children and Youth’s office estimates they receive 200 critical injury and death reports for kids in care every month, roughly 85 of which are related to the care they received or failed to receive. Deaths of Indigenous kids, including accidents and suicides, in for-profit group homes in B.C., Alberta and Ontario have also raised alarm in recent years. The federal and B.C. Governments have both committed to implementing the 94 Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the first five of which are about child welfare, as well as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which says that Indigenous people have the right to the shared raising of their own children. After knowing for decades that too many Indigenous children were going into care; federal, provincial and territorial governments are starting to act. Budgets are increasing for on and off-reserve services and the focus — at least in theory — has shifted to supporting families rather than taking children into care. But after 150 years of colonization through child apprehension, Indigenous groups are saying they want to run their own child welfare systems — and they want it now. The issues don’t just affect children and families living on reserves. Even off-reserve Indigenous children — who include status and non-status First Nations, Inuit and Métis children — are being taken into care before families can access services or supports. In Manitoba, where 90 per cent of the 11,000 children in care are Indigenous, First Nations mothers are losing their children within hours of birth. And ironically, one of the factors workers use in assessing whether to apprehend a child is if the mother spent time in government care herself. Manitoba uses a risk assessment tool checklist to determine whether children should be brought into care, a checklist that includes questions about parents’ past and current mental health and addictions issues. B.C. Uses such a tool, too, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Children and Family Development confirmed with The Tyee via email. “Ministry staff and service providers are trained in trauma-informed practice, including trauma caused by inter-generational issues such as those experienced by parents who have themselves been in the child welfare system or who were in residential schools,” they said. With a few exceptions we will examine later in this series, all child welfare agencies in Canada, whether operated by settler or Indigenous governments, must follow the child welfare legislation of the province or territory they are in. Katrine Conroy, B.C. Minister of children and family development, sees the system’s limitations. Current B.C. Legislation prevents social workers from reaching out to First Nations community leaders to find help for families before they go into care, she notes. It’s a rule her ministry is trying to change through Bill 26 introduced last month, which makes amendments to the Child, Family and Community Service Act to allow the director of child welfare to decide if a nation should be contacted. Critics, including the Representative for Children and Youth and several First Nations groups, say the proposed legislation was created without proper consultation with First Nations people and maintains the current paternalistic child welfare system. As it stands the act currently requires every household taking in a child, whether they’re extended family or strangers, must have a separate bedroom for every child. “Well, a grandma wanted to take her two grandsons, and she couldn’t because she didn’t have the spare room,” Conroy said, recalling a specific example she heard recently from a social worker. Minister for less than a year, Conroy admits she was surprised by the extent of the overrepresentation of Indigenous kids in the province’s child welfare system when she took on the job last summer. While Blackstock is not fully satisfied with the federal government’s promised funding and commitments to child welfare reform, she does have hope. Not just in the Indigenous youth she sees coming up today who, despite the odds stacked against them, are speaking out for other kids, youth and families in the system.

      "Question/Instruction: Reasoning: Why does Musselman emphasize a \"one-for-all-and-all-for-one\" mentality on his team, even though Caleb Martin is such a crucial player? Given material: What, exactly, did we learn about the Nevada Wolf Pack men's basketball team last week? Well, we learned that while the strength of the wolf is the pack, the strength of the Wolf Pack is definitely the Caleb. Every great wolf pack needs an alpha wolf. It's the law of the jungle. It was plain to see during an 86-78 loss to UNLV last Wednesday and an 83-58 victory over San Diego State just three days later that Caleb Martin fulfills that leadership role for the Wolf Pack basketball team. When Caleb Martin plays, as he did against San Diego State, the Wolf Pack is the best team in the Mountain West Conference, one of the Top 25 teams in the nation and a team that could find itself playing deep into the NCAA tournament next month. When Caleb Martin doesn't play, like against UNLV because of a left foot injury, the Wolf Pack staggers around the jungle without direction and allows potential prey to escape unharmed. Wolf Pack coach Eric Musselman was beside himself after the loss to UNLV because, at that moment, he had a basketball team without an alpha wolf. \"I have no idea,\" said Musselman when asked about Martin's injury after the UNLV game. \"Not good. I'm not talking about it anymore. He's out indefinitely.\" Musselman had nothing good to say about his Wolf Pack last Wednesday night. \"We didn't shoot the ball well,\" he said. \"We didn't defend well at all. We didn't rebound the ball well enough . . . Our defense stuck. Our rebounding stunk. Our loose ball getting stunk . . . There's so many concerning things . . . A lack of toughness . . . If they (the Pack players) don't defend we're not going to win another game the rest of the year . . . I don't know what's going to happen in the next three games.\" We're not sure about the next three games but we do know what happened in the next three days. Caleb Martin returned to the Wolf Pack basketball team and the Wolf Pack coach was seen smiling and joking again. \"This will be a better press conference tonight than the other night for sure,\" Musselman smiled as he took a seat behind the tape recorders after beating San Diego State. The real lesson to be learned from last week, is not that Caleb Martin is a very good basketball player. Everyone knew that before the last two games. Martin, after all, is currently the second leading scorer (19.4 points a game) in the Mountain West and is seventh in field goal percentage (.495), 10th in steals (1.2), third in 3-pointers (69) and 3-point percentage (.451). Before last week we knew Caleb Martin was the Pack's most talented and versatile scorer. But we weren't all that sure he was the most valuable player on the team. Heck, we weren't sure he was the most valuable Martin on the team. His twin brother Cody, for example, is 15th in the Mountain West in scoring (13.4), 13th in rebounding (6.1), fifth in assists (4.0), second in steals (1.7), fourth in blocks (1.5), fourth in field goal percentage (.521) and third in assist-to-turnover ration (2.1). \"Missing Caleb is a lot,\" Musselman said after the UNLV game. \"He's the potential MVP of the league . . . We miss Caleb. He makes everybody's job easier. (Without him) We can't shoot, we can't defend, we can't rebound.\" \"He's an important part of what they do,\" San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher told the San Diego Union-Tribune last Saturday. \"I think he gave them an emotional boost.\" Martin was just 3-of-12 from the floor for 10 points. He was just 2-of-10 on three and played just 23 minutes. That's how much Caleb Martin means to this Pack team. Even when he doesn't play particularly well, he affects games. \"He's just such a threat to make shots,\" Musselman said. \"Opposing teams have to honor him. It opens things up for everybody else, just him standing out there.\" Martin's mere presence on the floor made everybody around him better against San Diego State. That's because all of the Pack's beta and omega wolves didn't have the pressure of becoming an alpha wolf. Jordan Caroline and Kendall Stephens scored a combined 47 points against San Diego State after scoring just 34 combined against UNLV. Caroline had eight more points (26-18) on three fewer shots. Lindsey Drew scored more points against UNLV (17) compared to the UNLV game (12) but against UNLV he was a beta wolf out of his comfort zone. Against UNLV Drew was an inefficient 5-of-15 from the floor. Against San Diego State he was 5-of-8. Don't let Martin's performance fool you. His 23 minutes were pivotal to the Pack's victory. Martin entered the game with the Wolf Pack and Aztecs tied 13-13 with 15:15 to go in the first half. When he went back to the bench with 11:34 to go the Pack was up 16-15. He came back in with the Pack down 17-16 with 10:14 to go. When he went back to the bench with 3:33 to go in the half the Pack was up 30-27. He also hit a key shot with 1:10 to go, evening the game at 35-35 and making sure the Pack didn't trail at halftime. When he entered the game in the second half with 17:40 to go, the Pack led just 39-35. It took him all of 10 seconds to drain a 3-pointer for a 42-35 lead. When Musselman brought him back to the bench with 11:37 to go, the Pack was up 57-45. Martin turned a close game into a blowout. He played 9:48 in a stretch of 11:12 in the second half. During that 11:12 stretch, the Pack's lead went from 39-35 with 17:40 to go to 70-52 with 6:28 left. That's how much Martin means to this Wolf Pack team, whether he's scoring the points or not. Looking back, we should have known. It's likely not a coincidence that in the Pack's only two Mountain West losses this year, Martin either didn't play well (a 104-103 double overtime loss at Wyoming) or didn't play at all (UNLV). Martin scored just seven points and took just three shots over his final 30 minutes of playing time against Wyoming. Martin might be as valuable as any player the Wolf Pack has had in recent memory. Nick Fazekas missed just two games in his Wolf Pack career, both in his senior year in 2006-07, and the Pack won both games (at Hawaii and San Jose State). Luke Babbitt didn't miss a game in his two-year Pack career (2008-10) and neither did Deonte Burton in his four seasons (2010-14) so we'll never know if the Pack could have won without them. But we now know about Caleb Martin. Musselman, though, doesn't want so much emphasis placed on one player. He has tried to build a one-for-all-and-all-for-one mentality on this Pack team, where everybody shares the ball, everyone takes shots and where one player is just as valuable as another. Cody and Caleb Martin are the Pack's only set of twins but Musselman wants you to believe that the Pack starters are, in effect, quintuplets. \"Look, if Jordan (Caroline) was out, it would have an affect on us,\" Musselman said. \"If Lindsey (Drew) was out, when Cody was out at San Jose, we're not the same team.\" Notice he never said that the absence of Caroline, Drew or even Cody Martin would have the same affect as losing Caleb Martin. \"We're This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

      "\n",
      "Passage: A \"Price Watch\" sign for onions at a supermarket in Buenos Aires.\n",
      "Amid concerns about emerging market woes, Argentina’s new economic crisis made global headlines earlier this month. A new consumer price index registered rampant inflation of 3.7 percent in January — the highest official rate since 2002. Argentina has also yet to work out a debt settlement with its foreign financiers after the last default in 2001.\n",
      "On Feb. 3, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner presented a plan to combat inflation, asking Argentines to watch for and purchase from a list of 140 products with fixed prices, available at participating supermarkets, appliance stores and gas stations. The initiative known as “Precios Cuidados” (\"Price Watch\") has a website and a mobile app that, according to its Facebook page, has already been downloaded more than 59,000 times.\n",
      "The Precios Cuidados list is based on an agreement between the national government and local businesses meant to control and stabilize the cost of selected goods at affordable prices despite inflation and the peso’s instability. The fixed prices allow consumers to budget and stay within their spending limits when shopping for groceries and other household supplies.\n",
      "Hearing about these grim events, I thought about my generation — friends and classmates who stayed in the country living all of their 20s and the better half of their 30s through horrific inflation and its consequences. What were their losses? How did they adapt?\n",
      "In 1998, as inflation was going up, Argentine actor and producer Adrian Suar created a TV series called “Gasoleros.” The gasolero is a car that runs on diesel fuel, helping drivers spend less at the pump. It also stands for those who must live and adapt to the decline of the Argentine economy on a daily basis.\n",
      "Even after high school, many of my friends remained in gasolero mode. Amid inflated food, transportation and housing prices that stymied upward mobility, they eked out a living on meager salaries in Argentine pesos.\n",
      "In order to ease black-market demand for U.S. Dollars, Argentina allows those with a monthly income of 7,200 pesos ($900) or more to purchase up to $2,000 per month. But buying dollars as a saving measure each time the peso is devalued is not an option for those who live on limited income.\n",
      "Moreover, the volatility of the peso pushes low earners to spend all their disposable income. The crisis is creating “a generation that cannot grow or save,” according to Diana D., a 28-year-old visual artist who did not want to be identified with a full name. “We live on a day-to-day basis,” she added. “It’s better to spend the money than to save it because you never know how much the peso will be worth in the long run.\"\n",
      "It is unlikely that a temporary price fix would bring about economic stability to Argentina.\n",
      "Inflation is reflected in daily price hikes for food and other items. The peso plunged 19 percent in January from around 6.9 to 8 pesos per dollar in December, while prices went up by 3.7 percent, the highest increase in 11 years, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census. The crisis invited more scrutiny for the Kirchner administration, already struggling to address the country’s poverty and rising inequality.\n",
      "On Feb. 10, Kirchner defended the Precios Cuidados program with a message posted on her Facebook page, suggesting that Argentines should help the government implement the fixed-price agreement. Alluding to the era of military dictatorship and the “dirty war” of the 1970s and early ’80s, Kirchner asked the nation to remain united and not to lose sight of what it took “to get here.” She encouraged consumers to use the watch list as a resource to compare prices with those in the agreement, and invited them to file complaints against stores that don’t honor the contract.\n",
      "A temporary price fix is unlikely to bring about economic stability. Yet, given the country’s history of dictatorship, Argentines on a gasolero budget are giving the program their best shot, many sharing their experiences with “Price Watch” on Twitter. Others are more wary.\n",
      "\"Precios Cuidados exist because the government did not look out for inflation, currency, and emission,” Patricia Bullrich, who leads the civic coalition Union for All and represents the city of Buenos Aires in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, wrote on Twitter.\n",
      "In urban areas, public organizing and protests are common forms of voicing discomfort. The level of sociopolitical participation in the public sphere is a common denominator of those who live a gasolero lifestyle and are most affected by the economic flux.\n",
      "As a result, Argentine consumers are increasingly taking to the streets to protest the unmitigated price hikes. On Feb. 7 thousands of people participated in the Apagón de Consumo (Consumer Blackout), which asked citizens not to make any purchases in supermarkets for 24 hours to protest the unmeasured rise in prices. Activists posted images on Twitter of empty aisles in stores around the country, encouraging more people to join the boycott.\n",
      "Some Argentine economists have also questioned the economic rationale and sustainability of the Precios Cuidados. \"This plan considers inflation as an independent phenomenon isolated from the other symptoms,” said Mercedes D'Alessandro, economist and researcher at the University of Buenos Aires, in an email response last week. \"It allows people to think that the sole cause of inflation is the power that supermarket businesses have over prices. This idea is difficult to sustain.\"\n",
      "Others say the opposition spearheads the negative reactions. In a recent op-ed published by Telam News Agency, Argentine economist Artemio Lopez argued that, despite the opposition's doomsday predictions, a similar program under President Juan Domingo Peron was successfully implemented in 1954 and 1974. “The measures taken then by the president ... To control prices in times of inflation managed to revert the situation, as inflation went from 38 percent in 1952 to 3.8 percent by 1954,” Lopez wrote.\n",

      "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How have Argentine consumers responded to the Precios Cuidados program and the larger issue of inflation and rising prices?\n",
      "\n",
      "Passage: A \"Price Watch\" sign for onions at a supermarket in Buenos Aires.\n",
      "Amid concerns about emerging market woes, Argentina’s new economic crisis made global headlines earlier this month. A new consumer price index registered rampant inflation of 3.7 percent in January — the highest official rate since 2002. Argentina has also yet to work out a debt settlement with its foreign financiers after the last default in 2001.\n",
      "On Feb. 3, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner presented a plan to combat inflation, asking Argentines to watch for and purchase from a list of 140 products with fixed prices, available at participating supermarkets, appliance stores and gas stations. The initiative known as “Precios Cuidados” (\"Price Watch\") has a website and a mobile app that, according to its Facebook page, has already been downloaded more than 59,000 times.\n",
      "The Precios Cuidados list is based on an agreement between the national government and local businesses meant to control and stabilize the cost of selected goods at affordable prices despite inflation and the peso’s instability. The fixed prices allow consumers to budget and stay within their spending limits when shopping for groceries and other household supplies.\n",
      "Hearing about these grim events, I thought about my generation — friends and classmates who stayed in the country living all of their 20s and the better half of their 30s through horrific inflation and its consequences. What were their losses? How did they adapt?\n",
      "In 1998, as inflation was going up, Argentine actor and producer Adrian Suar created a TV series called “Gasoleros.” The gasolero is a car that runs on diesel fuel, helping drivers spend less at the pump. It also stands for those who must live and adapt to the decline of the Argentine economy on a daily basis.\n",
      "Even after high school, many of my friends remained in gasolero mode. Amid inflated food, transportation and housing prices that stymied upward mobility, they eked out a living on meager salaries in Argentine pesos.\n",
      "In order to ease black-market demand for U.S. Dollars, Argentina allows those with a monthly income of 7,200 pesos ($900) or more to purchase up to $2,000 per month. But buying dollars as a saving measure each time the peso is devalued is not an option for those who live on limited income.\n",
      "Moreover, the volatility of the peso pushes low earners to spend all their disposable income. The crisis is creating “a generation that cannot grow or save,” according to Diana D., a 28-year-old visual artist who did not want to be identified with a full name. “We live on a day-to-day basis,” she added. “It’s better to spend the money than to save it because you never know how much the peso will be worth in the long run.\"\n",
      "It is unlikely that a temporary price fix would bring about economic stability to Argentina.\n",
      "Inflation is reflected in daily price hikes for food and other items. The peso plunged 19 percent in January from around 6.9 to 8 pesos per dollar in December, while prices went up by 3.7 percent, the highest increase in 11 years, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census. The crisis invited more scrutiny for the Kirchner administration, already struggling to address the country’s poverty and rising inequality.\n",
      "On Feb. 10, Kirchner defended the Precios Cuidados program with a message posted on her Facebook page, suggesting that Argentines should help the government implement the fixed-price agreement. Alluding to the era of military dictatorship and the “dirty war” of the 1970s and early ’80s, Kirchner asked the nation to remain united and not to lose sight of what it took “to get here.” She encouraged consumers to use the watch list as a resource to compare prices with those in the agreement, and invited them to file complaints against stores that don’t honor the contract.\n",
      "A temporary price fix is unlikely to bring about economic stability. Yet, given the country’s history of dictatorship, Argentines on a gasolero budget are giving the program their best shot, many sharing their experiences with “Price Watch” on Twitter. Others are more wary.\n",
      "\"Precios Cuidados exist because the government did not look out for inflation, currency, and emission,” Patricia Bullrich, who leads the civic coalition Union for All and represents the city of Buenos Aires in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, wrote on Twitter.\n",
      "In urban areas, public organizing and protests are common forms of voicing discomfort. The level of sociopolitical participation in the public sphere is a common denominator of those who live a gasolero lifestyle and are most affected by the economic flux.\n",
      "As a result, Argentine consumers are increasingly taking to the streets to protest the unmitigated price hikes. On Feb. 7 thousands of people participated in the Apagón de Consumo (Consumer Blackout), which asked citizens not to make any purchases in supermarkets for 24 hours to protest the unmeasured rise in prices. Activists posted images on Twitter of empty aisles in stores around the country, encouraging more people to join the boycott.\n",
      "Some Argentine economists have also questioned the economic rationale and sustainability of the Precios Cuidados. \"This plan considers inflation as an independent phenomenon isolated from the other symptoms,” said Mercedes D'Alessandro, economist and researcher at the University of Buenos Aires, in an email response last week. \"It allows people to think that the sole cause of inflation is the power that supermarket businesses have over prices. This idea is difficult to sustain.\"\n",
      "Others say the opposition spearheads the negative reactions. In a recent op-ed published by Telam News Agency, Argentine economist Artemio Lopez argued that, despite the opposition's doomsday predictions, a similar program under President Juan Domingo Peron was successfully implemented in 1954 and 1974. “The measures taken then by the president ... To control prices in times of inflation managed to revert the situation, as inflation went from 38 percent in 1952 to 3.8 percent by 1954,” Lopez wrote.\n",

      "Question/Instruction: Can you summarize the achievements and philanthropy of Harris Rosen, a prominent businessman and philanthropist in Central Florida?\n",
      "\n",
      "Given material: Longtime readers of Orlando Sentinel editorials might think they've awakened in the Twilight Zone.\n",
      "The Sentinel's editorial board has had some epic disagreements with hotelier Harris Rosen. Over a light-rail system between downtown Orlando and International Drive. Over the tax value of his property. Over the plan to tap tourist taxes to build three venues in downtown Orlando. We're on opposite sides again on a current controversy, whether a proposal to legalize resort casinos should allow them in Central Florida.\n",
      "Yet for the editorial board, these disputes don't overshadow Rosen's achievements as one of Central Florida's most successful and visionary businessmen and one of its most generous philanthropists. He has created thousands of jobs, given millions to a long list of good causes, and devoted much of his personal energy to them.\n",
      "We chose Rosen as our 2011 Central Floridian of the Year, not with reservation but with enthusiasm.\n",
      "The story of Rosen's rise is worthy of a Horatio Alger novel. Born in 1939, he grew up in a gritty part of Manhattan known as the Bowery.\n",
      "\"It was not a gated community,\" he says dryly. \"One learned to be rather self-reliant and tough. Looking back I wouldn't trade that experience for anything.\"\n",
      "Rosen and his brother were told by their parents — neither of whom went to college — that education was the key \"to make something of yourself.\" It was a childhood insight that would inform his adult philanthropy. He studied diligently, swam competitively, and got accepted at Cornell University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in hotel administration in 1961.\n",
      "After graduating, he served in the U.S. Army, where he learned about motivation and leadership.\n",
      "Rosen held a series of jobs with other hotels and resorts, including Disney, before going into business for himself in 1974. In the depths of a national recession, he bought a bankrupt hotel on International Drive for just $20,000. Today he's president and chief operating officer of Rosen Hotels and Resorts, with seven Central Florida properties — including that first hotel — 6,300 rooms and more than 3,500 employees.\n",
      "Frugality. He lived in his first hotel for 16 years, and still maintains his office in a couple of rooms there. On the job, he prefers polo shirts and blue jeans to business suits.\n",
      "Hard work. As he began his business, he did a half-dozen jobs himself. Even at 72, he maintains a grueling daily schedule.\n",
      "Little debt. His company saves tens of millions of dollars a year in interest payments, and was in better shape than his competitors to withstand the Great Recession.\n",
      "Rosen also figures his company saves some $20 million a year by encouraging healthy lifestyles among employees, whom he calls associates, and providing them with health care at an on-site clinic, a money-saving model adopted by several local governments. Employees aren't allowed to smoke, but can get help quitting at company expense. If they're overweight, they can enroll in a supervised weight-loss program, also on the company's dime. A pair of members of Congress who visited to investigate his approach to health care told him it would save the nation $1 trillion if every U.S. Employer did the same.\n",
      "Rosen personally sets an example. He doesn't smoke or drink and exercises every day. Most workdays that includes an hour swimming at the YMCA Aquatic Center on I-Drive, a facility he helped rescue in 1992 with a $100,000 donation. Remarkably fit for a man his age, Rosen swims lap after lap, executing flip turns in between.\n",
      "Rosen wasn't focused on much beyond business during the early years of his career. A father of four, he married relatively late in life. But about two decades ago, \"I said to myself, 'You know, Harris, God has been so incredibly good to you. … It's time for you to demonstrate that appreciation and start giving back to those who need a helping hand.'\"\n",
      "In 1993, he launched his signature effort to give back. At the encouragement of Mable Butler, Orange County's first African-American commissioner, he adopted Tangelo Park, a poor, predominantly African-American neighborhood of about 2,400 residents not far from the I-Drive tourist corridor that made him rich.\n",
      "Rosen promised to provide free pre-school for all of the community's 2-, 3-, and 4-year-olds, and to bankroll scholarships to cover the full costs of college or vocational school for every graduating high school senior. He established a center to provide counseling and courses for parents, and expanded the community's YMCA.\n",
      "Rosen's charitable foundation has contributed some $9 million to make good on his promises to Tangelo Park. More than 400 children have benefited from free preschool, and more than 200 high-school graduates have received scholarships. The drop-out rate and crime in the neighborhood plummeted, while property values and pride soared.\n",
      "Georgia Gordon, now 63, was a single mother living in Tangelo Park when Rosen adopted the neighborhood. She got a job as one of the program's licensed preschool providers. One of her daughters eventually received a Rosen-provided college scholarship and now works as an executive with an Orlando payroll company. Three of her grandchildren also got scholarships.\n",
      "\"This man has blessed my family,\" says Gordon, who knows Rosen and calls him a friend. \"I wish there was someone like him in other communities.\"\n",
      "Rosen considers his Tangelo Park program another template for national policy — in this case, turning around the nation's struggling neighborhoods without relying on government. If other businesses and foundations would adopt those communities, \"We would not recognize America,\" he says.\n",
      "For more than a decade, Rosen has taken an ambitious and transformational approach to helping Haiti, where up to a third of his hotel employees have roots. \"That little country has just suffered so,\" he says.\n",
      "Rosen's foundation has donated and delivered school and medical supplies to Haiti. It has raised enough money to provide and maintain 200 water-filtration devices in rural areas. After Haiti was devastated by an earthquake a year ago, he arranged emergency relief shipments and spearheaded a drive to raise $1 million, contributing $250,000 of his own.\n",
      "Shifting his attention to a sustainable future for the country, he launched a program to provide Haitians with low-cost, energy-efficient and disaster-resistant houses in small, self-sufficient villages. Rosen is partnering with the Catholic Church, and met with Haiti's president during a visit last year to the country to inspect the site for the first village. It's typical of his hands-on approach to the causes he supports.\n",
      "The Haiti project reflects the innovative side of Rosen's philanthropy, also seen in another recent project close to home. Last year 53 Orange County schools began serving more-nutritious pizza from a recipe he created to encourage kids to eat healthier. All of his profits from selling the pizza go to scholarships and educational grants.\n",
      "Just a few of the other highlights in Rosen's extensive record of giving include money and land totaling $18 million to establish a campus for the University of Central Florida's Rosen College of Hospitality Management; $3.5 million to build a Jewish community center; and ongoing sponsorship for military organizations. He encourages his employees to get involved by helping to choose the causes to support and dedicating their time as volunteers.\n",
      "Rosen has a well-earned reputation not just for giving but also for tenaciously promoting his business interests.\n",
      "\"I'd rather be on the same side of an issue with him than the opposite side,\" says former Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty. \"He's a formidable opponent.\"\n",
      "Crotty locked horns with Rosen as the mayor helped lead the successful effort in 2007 to raise the county's hotel/motel tax by a penny and dedicate the proceeds to building a downtown arena and a performing-arts center and refurbishing the Citrus Bowl. Years earlier, when he was Orange County property appraiser, Crotty clashed with Rosen over the tax value of one of his hotels.\n",
      "Yet Crotty considers Rosen a friend, and calls himself a \"huge admirer\" of the hotel magnate. In 2008, the year after Crotty and Rosen had squared off over the venues, Crotty's teenage son was involved in a serious car accident that injured a young child This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

      "Question/Instruction: Can you summarize the achievements and philanthropy of Harris Rosen, a prominent businessman and philanthropist in Central Florida?\n",
      "\n",
      "Given material: Longtime readers of Orlando Sentinel editorials might think they've awakened in the Twilight Zone.\n",
      "The Sentinel's editorial board has had some epic disagreements with hotelier Harris Rosen. Over a light-rail system between downtown Orlando and International Drive. Over the tax value of his property. Over the plan to tap tourist taxes to build three venues in downtown Orlando. We're on opposite sides again on a current controversy, whether a proposal to legalize resort casinos should allow them in Central Florida.\n",
      "Yet for the editorial board, these disputes don't overshadow Rosen's achievements as one of Central Florida's most successful and visionary businessmen and one of its most generous philanthropists. He has created thousands of jobs, given millions to a long list of good causes, and devoted much of his personal energy to them.\n",
      "We chose Rosen as our 2011 Central Floridian of the Year, not with reservation but with enthusiasm.\n",
      "The story of Rosen's rise is worthy of a Horatio Alger novel. Born in 1939, he grew up in a gritty part of Manhattan known as the Bowery.\n",
      "\"It was not a gated community,\" he says dryly. \"One learned to be rather self-reliant and tough. Looking back I wouldn't trade that experience for anything.\"\n",
      "Rosen and his brother were told by their parents — neither of whom went to college — that education was the key \"to make something of yourself.\" It was a childhood insight that would inform his adult philanthropy. He studied diligently, swam competitively, and got accepted at Cornell University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in hotel administration in 1961.\n",
      "After graduating, he served in the U.S. Army, where he learned about motivation and leadership.\n",
      "Rosen held a series of jobs with other hotels and resorts, including Disney, before going into business for himself in 1974. In the depths of a national recession, he bought a bankrupt hotel on International Drive for just $20,000. Today he's president and chief operating officer of Rosen Hotels and Resorts, with seven Central Florida properties — including that first hotel — 6,300 rooms and more than 3,500 employees.\n",
      "Frugality. He lived in his first hotel for 16 years, and still maintains his office in a couple of rooms there. On the job, he prefers polo shirts and blue jeans to business suits.\n",
      "Hard work. As he began his business, he did a half-dozen jobs himself. Even at 72, he maintains a grueling daily schedule.\n",
      "Little debt. His company saves tens of millions of dollars a year in interest payments, and was in better shape than his competitors to withstand the Great Recession.\n",
      "Rosen also figures his company saves some $20 million a year by encouraging healthy lifestyles among employees, whom he calls associates, and providing them with health care at an on-site clinic, a money-saving model adopted by several local governments. Employees aren't allowed to smoke, but can get help quitting at company expense. If they're overweight, they can enroll in a supervised weight-loss program, also on the company's dime. A pair of members of Congress who visited to investigate his approach to health care told him it would save the nation $1 trillion if every U.S. Employer did the same.\n",
      "Rosen personally sets an example. He doesn't smoke or drink and exercises every day. Most workdays that includes an hour swimming at the YMCA Aquatic Center on I-Drive, a facility he helped rescue in 1992 with a $100,000 donation. Remarkably fit for a man his age, Rosen swims lap after lap, executing flip turns in between.\n",
      "Rosen wasn't focused on much beyond business during the early years of his career. A father of four, he married relatively late in life. But about two decades ago, \"I said to myself, 'You know, Harris, God has been so incredibly good to you. … It's time for you to demonstrate that appreciation and start giving back to those who need a helping hand.'\"\n",
      "In 1993, he launched his signature effort to give back. At the encouragement of Mable Butler, Orange County's first African-American commissioner, he adopted Tangelo Park, a poor, predominantly African-American neighborhood of about 2,400 residents not far from the I-Drive tourist corridor that made him rich.\n",
      "Rosen promised to provide free pre-school for all of the community's 2-, 3-, and 4-year-olds, and to bankroll scholarships to cover the full costs of college or vocational school for every graduating high school senior. He established a center to provide counseling and courses for parents, and expanded the community's YMCA.\n",
      "Rosen's charitable foundation has contributed some $9 million to make good on his promises to Tangelo Park. More than 400 children have benefited from free preschool, and more than 200 high-school graduates have received scholarships. The drop-out rate and crime in the neighborhood plummeted, while property values and pride soared.\n",
      "Georgia Gordon, now 63, was a single mother living in Tangelo Park when Rosen adopted the neighborhood. She got a job as one of the program's licensed preschool providers. One of her daughters eventually received a Rosen-provided college scholarship and now works as an executive with an Orlando payroll company. Three of her grandchildren also got scholarships.\n",
      "\"This man has blessed my family,\" says Gordon, who knows Rosen and calls him a friend. \"I wish there was someone like him in other communities.\"\n",
      "Rosen considers his Tangelo Park program another template for national policy — in this case, turning around the nation's struggling neighborhoods without relying on government. If other businesses and foundations would adopt those communities, \"We would not recognize America,\" he says.\n",
      "For more than a decade, Rosen has taken an ambitious and transformational approach to helping Haiti, where up to a third of his hotel employees have roots. \"That little country has just suffered so,\" he says.\n",
      "Rosen's foundation has donated and delivered school and medical supplies to Haiti. It has raised enough money to provide and maintain 200 water-filtration devices in rural areas. After Haiti was devastated by an earthquake a year ago, he arranged emergency relief shipments and spearheaded a drive to raise $1 million, contributing $250,000 of his own.\n",
      "Shifting his attention to a sustainable future for the country, he launched a program to provide Haitians with low-cost, energy-efficient and disaster-resistant houses in small, self-sufficient villages. Rosen is partnering with the Catholic Church, and met with Haiti's president during a visit last year to the country to inspect the site for the first village. It's typical of his hands-on approach to the causes he supports.\n",
      "The Haiti project reflects the innovative side of Rosen's philanthropy, also seen in another recent project close to home. Last year 53 Orange County schools began serving more-nutritious pizza from a recipe he created to encourage kids to eat healthier. All of his profits from selling the pizza go to scholarships and educational grants.\n",
      "Just a few of the other highlights in Rosen's extensive record of giving include money and land totaling $18 million to establish a campus for the University of Central Florida's Rosen College of Hospitality Management; $3.5 million to build a Jewish community center; and ongoing sponsorship for military organizations. He encourages his employees to get involved by helping to choose the causes to support and dedicating their time as volunteers.\n",
      "Rosen has a well-earned reputation not just for giving but also for tenaciously promoting his business interests.\n",
      "\"I'd rather be on the same side of an issue with him than the opposite side,\" says former Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty. \"He's a formidable opponent.\"\n",
      "Crotty locked horns with Rosen as the mayor helped lead the successful effort in 2007 to raise the county's hotel/motel tax by a penny and dedicate the proceeds to building a downtown arena and a performing-arts center and refurbishing the Citrus Bowl. Years earlier, when he was Orange County property appraiser, Crotty clashed with Rosen over the tax value of one of his hotels.\n",
      "Yet Crotty considers Rosen a friend, and calls himself a \"huge admirer\" of the hotel magnate. In 2008, the year after Crotty and Rosen had squared off over the venues, Crotty's teenage son was involved in a serious car accident that injured a young child This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

      "Here is a piece of text: You’ve got to hand it to the folks running the mini-empire formerly known as Twin Cities Public Television. Twelve years ago when they added a second broadcast channel, there was a bit of fanfare about their rebranding as TPT.\n",
      "But what have they said about their conquests since then? Perhaps they have just been waiting, Minnesota coy, for someone to come along and ask.\n",
      "Since TPT17 joined TPT2, TPT WX and TPT MN and digital sub-channels have been launched with little fanfare. Nor has there been much bragging about the fact that the TPT has some of the highest Nielsen ratings in the PBS universe. Or about the Emmys, or the nearly fanatical devotion its Friday night public affairs show inspires in some circles, or the steady stream of programming it exports to its PBS brethren around the country.\n",
      "Maybe it should come as no surprise, then, that the leaders of the 65-year-old institution once colloquially referred to as “educational TV” are only half joking when they say they have finished the first, “quiet phase” of a $30 million capital campaign and are now ready to start talking about it — modestly.\n",
      "In point of fact, it sounds audacious: They have begun spending a little of the $20 million raised to date on a plan to offer not just broadcasting, but lifelong digital learning opportunities for anyone with a pod, pad, phone, classroom whiteboard or, to make sure the Luddites don’t get left behind, a TV.\n",
      "MinnPost: The new TPT — how did the idea get birthed?\n",
      "Jim Pagliarini: Back in 2008 we, like so many stations, were struggling to figure out what our future was and how we could continue to be relevant. We went through a very intensive planning process at the station where we affirmed that TPT should be around for the next six decades. The media was still going to play a really important role in education and public service, so there was an affirmation of our mission and purpose.\n",
      "The second thing — that didn’t take really a genius to see — is that there’s a revolution going on in the media landscape. The way consumers are using media is changing. There’s a new generation of people who are not sitting down after dinner saying, “Honey, let’s go watch ‘Masterpiece Theater.’ ” And there is available to us a whole new set of tools to use to pursue our mission.\n",
      "We looked at all of that and said, we’ve been a very good television station for almost six decades — the station signed on the air in 1957 — but we really need to deliberately go through a transformation where we continue to build on our television competencies, but start to bring in resources, talents and projects that take advantage of new tools and new ways to reach new consumers of public media.\n",
      "Our core business is doing very well. Every year we have a balanced budget. Lots of people use us, but we don’t have the excess revenue to invest in new ideas and in the new infrastructure and tools that we need to help transform it to this new media organization. The way you raise capital and venture capital in the nonprofit world in order to do new things is through campaigns.\n",
      "MP: Can you talk a little bit about demand? Were you looking at where you could be of highest service?\n",
      "JP: The campaign is supporting three things. One is adding to our endowment. We have an operating budget of about $28 million a year, and we only have about a $12 million endowment. We’re trying to add to that endowment to assure some financial stability, and we’re doing that largely through planned gifts and estate gifts to the campaign. Of the $21 million we’ve already raised, a little over $2.5 million has come from members declaring an estate gift to the station, which we will realize sometime in the future.\n",
      "The other investment in the station is a renovation of our facility, which is 25 years old. We’re right across the street from Union Depot [in downtown St. Paul]. The light rail will literally stop in front of our door. We have a plan to renew the space and open it up to the public. In fact, to create a public gathering space at the street level, move our entrance down to the street level, and have our physical presence tangibly reflect the new open philosophy of TPT.\n",
      "Then, getting to your question of demand and what we are going to focus on in terms of programs and services, that is a component of the capital campaign, which is all about investing in new ideas and new areas of focus for the station.\n",
      "We will continue to be a television station and have a general-audience service. PBS, primetime programming, our children’s schedule, but we’re really wanting to develop four centers of excellence that will target certain activities.\n",
      "One is to build on our work with the Minnesota Channel, which we launched 10 years ago when we were struggling with how to provide vibrant public television service to a community when making television is so expensive. We said maybe there’s a way we could do more programming if we do it in partnership with other mission-similar organizations.\n",
      "It’s a very robust service. In the last decade, we worked with almost 215 nonprofit organizations, produced 900 or 1,000 hours of programming. Demand from organizations that want to work with us exceeds our capacity. Campaign funds already have been used to bring on more staff to work with community organizations to co-produce programs.\n",
      "The other focus area that we’re spending time and energy in is beefing up our service to children, families, teachers and caregivers. PBS has a huge repository of really strong educational programs that now extends far beyond the broadcast schedule. If you look at our website — what’s available for parents, teachers and kids online — it’s just a tremendous resource. A lot of people don’t know it exists and need help understanding how to use it.\n",
      "We brought on three full-time people to start working in the community with organizations providing services to children and families to increase awareness and the use of this programming, both online and on air.\n",
      "We’re also rolling out something that PBS has created, that we’ll supplement with our own programming called the PBS-TPT Digital Learning Library. PBS has digitized its library, cut it into learning segments and correlated them to state educational standards so teachers will be able to draw on and use this resource in their classroom. A teacher is able to find the exact five-, six-minute segment from an American Experience series on Franklin Delano Roosevelt to use in the classroom.\n",
      "And we’ve digitized our archives. Right now you could type in “Paul Wellstone” and see clips of every time Paul Wellstone appeared on either “News Night Minnesota” or “Almanac.” We’ll be integrating our library video content into the PBS library.\n",
      "We also saw a huge opportunity and a need to address America’s older population. We launched a service called Next Avenue, which recognizes the fact that there are two significant trends occurring in the nation. One, there was this huge population moving into the 50-plus demographic, against the backdrop of the longevity revolution.\n",
      "We saw this huge need to give people good information at an early stage of becoming old — we call it the young old — to be able to make good decisions about their health, their finances, about how to continue to work if you need to or how might you do volunteerism as you age. We put together a national website.\n",
      "This is the first time a station has ever created a national PBS media product that’s something other than television. Typically, we produce TV shows, and distribute them to stations. We have given away Next Avenue to every PBS station in the country and have established a whole network of partners ranging from Huffington Post to the National Institute on Aging. Our job is to curate and to create content. We have a group of 10 editors and journalists who are working on Next Avenue all over the country.\n",
      "The last area is the one that is least developed but in many ways for me is incredibly exciting. The Next Generation Initiative recognizes that not only is America graying, PBS is graying. I started working in PBS when I was 23. My generation had a chance to build what public television is today. There needs to be a transition of energy and leadership to a new generation here in the Twin Cities, to define and create what public media is going to be for this state.\n",
      "Part of the campaign funds are going to invest in bringing a new team of people in who really know how to use interactive media to begin to figure out what is the 21st century version of “Almanac.” How do you connect with the younger generation to get them engaged civically? How do you tell the history of Minnesota in a different storytelling language than television?\n",
      "We’re saying, understand the mission, the values, the principles and the purpose. Now, how do you do it? Go figure it out. As a tangible example, in 2008 we were spending $60,000 a year on interactive media. This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

      "Here is a piece of text: TO read the official guide to Israel's 50th anniversary celebrations this year, one might think hardly a day has passed since last November without some gala event to mark the jubilee, and the hectic pace of revelry will persevere right through a Closing Event at the end of 1998.\n",
      "In fact, the closing event has yet to be scheduled, and the large majority of events listed in the glossy book are annual or local affairs, often having little to do with the 50th, that have deftly been heaped onto the anniversary bandwagon.\n",
      "To a degree, that's the nature of the beast. Anniversaries are a natural time for civic boosters, museums, annual festivals, veterans' groups, municipal councils, military organizations and the like to reach for some extra attention and attendance.\n",
      "In Israel, however, the recently issued program, ''Israel Celebrates Its 50th Anniversary,'' is still a fairly transparent effort to put a cheery and busy facade on a jubilee whose organization has suffered from severe infighting, and whose gloss has been tarnished by a political climate that has caused a serious drop in tourism.\n",
      "That is not to say there won't be partying. On Thursday, Israeli Independence Day, the Givat Ram Stadium in Jerusalem will play host tothe central event, a ''Jubilee Bells Show,'' which will include music, dance, ballet, literature and theater by dozens of Israeli performers and artists (but no literal bell-ringing). Ticket prices are about $28, $55 and $83, and are available through the Kastel ticket agency, (972-3) 604-4725 or Bimot, (972-2) 624-0896.\n",
      "The gala celebration will be broadcast on both major Israeli television channels and in many countries overseas. TV, in fact, may be the best way to watch. The Givat Ram stadium has only 12,000 seats, and 5,000 are reserved for invited guests from the world over, including Vice President Al Gore, as well as Israel's President Ezer Weizman, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials. Israel does have bigger stadiums, but organizers wanted Jerusalem, to drive home the point that this is the Israeli capital, even if most foreign governments have yet to recognize it.\n",
      "Other events planned for Thursday include a march by thousands of soldiers through Jerusalem, a naval review with as many as 400 vessels along the coast, culminating north of Tel Aviv, and a combined Army-Navy-Air Force spectacle on the shores of Tel Aviv. Military bases will be open to civilian visitors.\n",
      "On Wednesday, the eve of Independence Day, both the Israel Philharmonic and the Jerusalem Symphonic Orchestras will offer special concerts in Jerusalem, the former at the International Convention Center (Binyene ha-Uma), the latter at the Jerusalem Theater. Ticket prices for the Israel Philharmonic concert range from about $42 to $140, and are available from major ticket agencies, including Klaim, (972-2) 625-6869, and Bimot, (972-2) 624-0896. The Independence Day Gala at the Jerusalem Theater will also include ethnic music and a dance party with a 1960's band. Tickets are about $33 for the balcony and $42 in the orchestra. They can be purchased through the box office at (972-2) 561-1498.\n",
      "According to a Government decision made in March, the holiday will extend to Friday, when most offices and stores will be closed. Among events on that day, the declaration of Israel's independence will be re-enacted at the Great Synagogue in Tel Aviv, followed by a concert of cantors.\n",
      "On Saturday, Zubin Mehta will conduct the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, with stars like Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas Zukerman participating, in a free evening concert of Hebrew songs, at the Ganei Yehoshua Park in Tel Aviv. The concert will be televised live.\n",
      "Various special exhibitions have been planned. The Israel Museum in Jerusalem will hold eight exhibitions throughout the year to explore Israel's cultural heritage, including one on the menorah, and others on Orientalism in Israeli arts, the home in Israeli society, photography in Israel, and watercolors in Israeli art.\n",
      "Among the more colorful jubilee events is a simultaneous chess match May 19 and May 21 between Gary Kasparov, the world chess champion, and the Israeli national chess team, at the Kasparov Chess Academy in Tel Aviv.\n",
      "Another, starting on May 10 in London, stars 25 rare antique cars that will leave for Israel to raise money for reservoirs in the southern Negev Desert. With the cars will come the British flag that was taken down in Haifa in 1948 at the end of the British Mandate governing Palestine. The cars are scheduled to arrive in Haifa on May 24, after making the last leg of their journey by sea from Greece. They will then drive through various settlements before being displayed in Jerusalem on May 26 and 27.\n",
      "In August, the Israeli Government will mount a jubilee exhibition (with a gala opening on Aug. 3) tracing the development of the state at Tel Aviv's fairgrounds. In the words of the official program: ''The exhibition also focuses on the younger generation so that it will know how to appreciate the magnitude of the achievement called the State of Israel, thus laying down roots and reinforcing them in the world's only Jewish state.'' The festival will continue through Aug. 31.\n",
      "Among events in the fall will be a mass public assembly on Oct. 6 at the Western Wall plaza in Jerusalem, intended to renew ''the ancient Jewish tradition of holding mass public gatherings at the temple once every seven years.'' Another event tied to the anniversary will be the Festival of Humor, Laughter and Satire in the Negev city of Beersheva Oct. 6 to 8.\n",
      "These festive events have failed to cloak the confusion and controversy that have accompanied the preparations. Three directors of the jubilee organizing committee quit in political, budgetary and personal squabbles with Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav. In February, Mr. Katsav also withdrew as the minister overseeing the events. In the same month the current director, Doron Shmueli, took charge.\n",
      "As a result, the opening date for the year was repeatedly pushed back. Originally to take place Nov. 29, the anniversary of the United Nations partition plan for Palestine, it then moved to the first night of Hanukkah, Dec. 23. The formal inauguration finally occurred on Feb. 11, the tree-planting holiday of Tu b'Shevat, and passed without much notice.\n",
      "Though the motto of the jubilee is ''Together With Pride, Together in Hope,'' the Labor Party has complained that its dominant role in the early decades of the state is being played down, and that its leaders were not invited to some events.\n",
      "The collage on the official program includes various historic events, but conspicuously excludes the handshake between Yitzhak Rabin, the late Prime Minister, and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, marking the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in 1993.\n",
      "The singer chosen to perform the national anthem on Independence Day, Rita, backed out in a huff after a minister questioned her $20,000 fee, and agreed to participate only after Prime Minister Netanyahu appealed to her by phone. She then said she would donate the money to charity.\n",
      "The listings of events under the broad umbrella of the 50th anniversary have also drawn criticism for lumping together official jubilee events, annual festivals, and locally organized events, both commercial and public. Many of these, such as the Arad music festival, or the Tiberias-to-Eilat bicycle trek, take place every year, and some tickets are quite expensive.\n",
      "Hotel and tour managers said they expect an increase in tourists for Independence Day, but that the jubilee year overall was likely to be another in a series of bad years. Ami Etgar, general manager of the Association of Tour Organizers, said tourism has been dropping since 1995, when 2.5 million tourists came to Israel. Original expectations, he said, had been for well over 3 million tourists in the jubilee year. But the prognosis now is for 1.9 million to 2.1 million tourists in 1998.\n",
      "More details about Jubilee events are available through the Ministry of Tourism in Jerusalem, at This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_seq_length`.\n",

      "Here is a piece of text: You’ve got to hand it to the folks running the mini-empire formerly known as Twin Cities Public Television. Twelve years ago when they added a second broadcast channel, there was a bit of fanfare about their rebranding as TPT.\n",
      "But what have they said about their conquests since then? Perhaps they have just been waiting, Minnesota coy, for someone to come along and ask.\n",
      "Since TPT17 joined TPT2, TPT WX and TPT MN and digital sub-channels have been launched with little fanfare. Nor has there been much bragging about the fact that the TPT has some of the highest Nielsen ratings in the PBS universe. Or about the Emmys, or the nearly fanatical devotion its Friday night public affairs show inspires in some circles, or the steady stream of programming it exports to its PBS brethren around the country.\n",
      "Maybe it should come as no surprise, then, that the leaders of the 65-year-old institution once colloquially referred to as “educational TV” are only half joking when they say they have finished the first, “quiet phase” of a $30 million capital campaign and are now ready to start talking about it — modestly.\n",
      "In point of fact, it sounds audacious: They have begun spending a little of the $20 million raised to date on a plan to offer not just broadcasting, but lifelong digital learning opportunities for anyone with a pod, pad, phone, classroom whiteboard or, to make sure the Luddites don’t get left behind, a TV.\n",
      "MinnPost: The new TPT — how did the idea get birthed?\n",
      "Jim Pagliarini: Back in 2008 we, like so many stations, were struggling to figure out what our future was and how we could continue to be relevant. We went through a very intensive planning process at the station where we affirmed that TPT should be around for the next six decades. The media was still going to play a really important role in education and public service, so there was an affirmation of our mission and purpose.\n",
      "The second thing — that didn’t take really a genius to see — is that there’s a revolution going on in the media landscape. The way consumers are using media is changing. There’s a new generation of people who are not sitting down after dinner saying, “Honey, let’s go watch ‘Masterpiece Theater.’ ” And there is available to us a whole new set of tools to use to pursue our mission.\n",
      "We looked at all of that and said, we’ve been a very good television station for almost six decades — the station signed on the air in 1957 — but we really need to deliberately go through a transformation where we continue to build on our television competencies, but start to bring in resources, talents and projects that take advantage of new tools and new ways to reach new consumers of public media.\n",
      "Our core business is doing very well. Every year we have a balanced budget. Lots of people use us, but we don’t have the excess revenue to invest in new ideas and in the new infrastructure and tools that we need to help transform it to this new media organization. The way you raise capital and venture capital in the nonprofit world in order to do new things is through campaigns.\n",
      "MP: Can you talk a little bit about demand? Were you looking at where you could be of highest service?\n",
      "JP: The campaign is supporting three things. One is adding to our endowment. We have an operating budget of about $28 million a year, and we only have about a $12 million endowment. We’re trying to add to that endowment to assure some financial stability, and we’re doing that largely through planned gifts and estate gifts to the campaign. Of the $21 million we’ve already raised, a little over $2.5 million has come from members declaring an estate gift to the station, which we will realize sometime in the future.\n",
      "The other investment in the station is a renovation of our facility, which is 25 years old. We’re right across the street from Union Depot [in downtown St. Paul]. The light rail will literally stop in front of our door. We have a plan to renew the space and open it up to the public. In fact, to create a public gathering space at the street level, move our entrance down to the street level, and have our physical presence tangibly reflect the new open philosophy of TPT.\n",
      "Then, getting to your question of demand and what we are going to focus on in terms of programs and services, that is a component of the capital campaign, which is all about investing in new ideas and new areas of focus for the station.\n",
      "We will continue to be a television station and have a general-audience service. PBS, primetime programming, our children’s schedule, but we’re really wanting to develop four centers of excellence that will target certain activities.\n",
      "One is to build on our work with the Minnesota Channel, which we launched 10 years ago when we were struggling with how to provide vibrant public television service to a community when making television is so expensive. We said maybe there’s a way we could do more programming if we do it in partnership with other mission-similar organizations.\n",
      "It’s a very robust service. In the last decade, we worked with almost 215 nonprofit organizations, produced 900 or 1,000 hours of programming. Demand from organizations that want to work with us exceeds our capacity. Campaign funds already have been used to bring on more staff to work with community organizations to co-produce programs.\n",
      "The other focus area that we’re spending time and energy in is beefing up our service to children, families, teachers and caregivers. PBS has a huge repository of really strong educational programs that now extends far beyond the broadcast schedule. If you look at our website — what’s available for parents, teachers and kids online — it’s just a tremendous resource. A lot of people don’t know it exists and need help understanding how to use it.\n",
      "We brought on three full-time people to start working in the community with organizations providing services to children and families to increase awareness and the use of this programming, both online and on air.\n",
      "We’re also rolling out something that PBS has created, that we’ll supplement with our own programming called the PBS-TPT Digital Learning Library. PBS has digitized its library, cut it into learning segments and correlated them to state educational standards so teachers will be able to draw on and use this resource in their classroom. A teacher is able to find the exact five-, six-minute segment from an American Experience series on Franklin Delano Roosevelt to use in the classroom.\n",
      "And we’ve digitized our archives. Right now you could type in “Paul Wellstone” and see clips of every time Paul Wellstone appeared on either “News Night Minnesota” or “Almanac.” We’ll be integrating our library video content into the PBS library.\n",
      "We also saw a huge opportunity and a need to address America’s older population. We launched a service called Next Avenue, which recognizes the fact that there are two significant trends occurring in the nation. One, there was this huge population moving into the 50-plus demographic, against the backdrop of the longevity revolution.\n",
      "We saw this huge need to give people good information at an early stage of becoming old — we call it the young old — to be able to make good decisions about their health, their finances, about how to continue to work if you need to or how might you do volunteerism as you age. We put together a national website.\n",
      "This is the first time a station has ever created a national PBS media product that’s something other than television. Typically, we produce TV shows, and distribute them to stations. We have given away Next Avenue to every PBS station in the country and have established a whole network of partners ranging from Huffington Post to the National Institute on Aging. Our job is to curate and to create content. We have a group of 10 editors and journalists who are working on Next Avenue all over the country.\n",
      "The last area is the one that is least developed but in many ways for me is incredibly exciting. The Next Generation Initiative recognizes that not only is America graying, PBS is graying. I started working in PBS when I was 23. My generation had a chance to build what public television is today. There needs to be a transition of energy and leadership to a new generation here in the Twin Cities, to define and create what public media is going to be for this state.\n",
      "Part of the campaign funds are going to invest in bringing a new team of people in who really know how to use interactive media to begin to figure out what is the 21st century version of “Almanac.” How do you connect with the younger generation to get them engaged civically? How do you tell the history of Minnesota in a different storytelling language than television?\n",
      "We’re saying, understand the mission, the values, the principles and the purpose. Now, how do you do it? Go figure it out. As a tangible example, in 2008 we were spending $60,000 a year on interactive media. This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_seq_length`.\n",

      "Here is a piece of text: TO read the official guide to Israel's 50th anniversary celebrations this year, one might think hardly a day has passed since last November without some gala event to mark the jubilee, and the hectic pace of revelry will persevere right through a Closing Event at the end of 1998.\n",
      "In fact, the closing event has yet to be scheduled, and the large majority of events listed in the glossy book are annual or local affairs, often having little to do with the 50th, that have deftly been heaped onto the anniversary bandwagon.\n",
      "To a degree, that's the nature of the beast. Anniversaries are a natural time for civic boosters, museums, annual festivals, veterans' groups, municipal councils, military organizations and the like to reach for some extra attention and attendance.\n",
      "In Israel, however, the recently issued program, ''Israel Celebrates Its 50th Anniversary,'' is still a fairly transparent effort to put a cheery and busy facade on a jubilee whose organization has suffered from severe infighting, and whose gloss has been tarnished by a political climate that has caused a serious drop in tourism.\n",
      "That is not to say there won't be partying. On Thursday, Israeli Independence Day, the Givat Ram Stadium in Jerusalem will play host tothe central event, a ''Jubilee Bells Show,'' which will include music, dance, ballet, literature and theater by dozens of Israeli performers and artists (but no literal bell-ringing). Ticket prices are about $28, $55 and $83, and are available through the Kastel ticket agency, (972-3) 604-4725 or Bimot, (972-2) 624-0896.\n",
      "The gala celebration will be broadcast on both major Israeli television channels and in many countries overseas. TV, in fact, may be the best way to watch. The Givat Ram stadium has only 12,000 seats, and 5,000 are reserved for invited guests from the world over, including Vice President Al Gore, as well as Israel's President Ezer Weizman, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials. Israel does have bigger stadiums, but organizers wanted Jerusalem, to drive home the point that this is the Israeli capital, even if most foreign governments have yet to recognize it.\n",
      "Other events planned for Thursday include a march by thousands of soldiers through Jerusalem, a naval review with as many as 400 vessels along the coast, culminating north of Tel Aviv, and a combined Army-Navy-Air Force spectacle on the shores of Tel Aviv. Military bases will be open to civilian visitors.\n",
      "On Wednesday, the eve of Independence Day, both the Israel Philharmonic and the Jerusalem Symphonic Orchestras will offer special concerts in Jerusalem, the former at the International Convention Center (Binyene ha-Uma), the latter at the Jerusalem Theater. Ticket prices for the Israel Philharmonic concert range from about $42 to $140, and are available from major ticket agencies, including Klaim, (972-2) 625-6869, and Bimot, (972-2) 624-0896. The Independence Day Gala at the Jerusalem Theater will also include ethnic music and a dance party with a 1960's band. Tickets are about $33 for the balcony and $42 in the orchestra. They can be purchased through the box office at (972-2) 561-1498.\n",
      "According to a Government decision made in March, the holiday will extend to Friday, when most offices and stores will be closed. Among events on that day, the declaration of Israel's independence will be re-enacted at the Great Synagogue in Tel Aviv, followed by a concert of cantors.\n",
      "On Saturday, Zubin Mehta will conduct the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, with stars like Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas Zukerman participating, in a free evening concert of Hebrew songs, at the Ganei Yehoshua Park in Tel Aviv. The concert will be televised live.\n",
      "Various special exhibitions have been planned.

      "Question/Instruction: How have major oil-and-gas companies shifted their stance on climate policy, and what role are they playing in shaping legislative solutions?\n",
      "\n",
      "Given material: When a group of more than 20 protesters showed up in the halls of the U.S. Senate on a recent February day, they would have been forgiven for expecting a chilly reception. For the past seven months, sit-ins at a range of offices–from California Governor Jerry Brown’s to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s–had followed a similar pattern: show up, sing songs, get led away in handcuffs for disrupting the peace. But on that particular Wednesday, things were different.\n",
      "It’s not just Democrats who suddenly want to focus on climate change. President Trump seized the opportunity to double down on his denial of climate science, while other Republicans began recalibrating their messaging. Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, an ardent defender of the President who introduced a bill in 2017 to eliminate the EPA, responded to Trump by tweeting, “Climate change is real.” In December, John Cornyn of Texas, who until recently served in GOP Senate leadership, tweeted positively about a tax on carbon emissions, and a month later, Republican Representative Francis Rooney of Florida and Democratic colleagues joined to introduce a carbon-tax measure in the House.\n",
      "This shift has been a long time coming. Scientists have understood for decades that climate change is happening and that humans are causing it; recent studies, including a landmark report in October from the U.N., have shown that things are even worse than we thought. Global temperatures have already risen 1°C since the Industrial Revolution; if the planet heats by much more than an additional half a degree, we could see some of the most catastrophic effects of climate change, including the death of the world’s coral reefs and the inundation of entire island nations.\n",
      "That reality has resonated with the public: more than 70% of Americans now understand that climate change is taking place, according to data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. A February NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey found that two-thirds of Republicans believe their party is “outside the mainstream” on the issue.\n",
      "Into this new political reality came the Green New Deal–equal parts policy proposal and battle cry. The resolution, introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, calls for the U.S. To launch a broad “mobilization” to decarbonize the economy while tackling a slew of other social ills. The response was mixed. People loved it. People loathed it. Others were confused by it. But in D.C., where climate has long been relegated to third-tier status, lawmakers could no longer avoid the issue.\n",
      "Within weeks of the proposal’s release, Democrats competed to burnish their green credentials. Nearly every Democratic candidate for the 2020 presidential nomination has endorsed the Green New Deal. Washington Governor Jay Inslee entered the race on a climate-themed campaign–something unthinkable just a few years ago, when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump didn’t field a single question about climate change in their presidential debates.\n",
      "Some Republicans scrambled to counter what they saw as a liberal threat: if they didn’t come up with a viable climate position, at least one they could point to rhetorically, they risked further ceding the issue to the Democrats, whose proposal they decry as socialist overreach. Behind the scenes, Republicans gathered in working groups trying to grasp for a solution. Major corporations–including in the oil-and-gas industry–pulled out their checkbooks to support conservative climate measures.\n",
      "Love the Green New Deal or hate it, the conversation it has unleashed represents a shift in the discussion surrounding climate policy in the U.S., with ripples that will spread across the globe. The outcome of the debate will go a long way toward determining if humanity can avoid the most catastrophic consequences of a rapidly warming world.\n",
      "Even before Ocasio-Cortez released her Green New Deal resolution, critics had begun to scrutinize the program, using every detail as a chance to condemn it. A congressional newcomer, Ocasio-Cortez has developed a reputation for taking critics and their talking points head-on, but in a recent interview with TIME she rejected the idea that she should have to defend the particulars.\n",
      "“It’s a statement. It’s a vision document. And people want to pick it apart to death,” she says, agreeing with those who liken her proposal to the “bold persistent experimentation” that President Franklin Roosevelt advocated to end the Great Depression. “I hope that we start to get to more of an experimental spirit in government,” she says.\n",
      "Around the same time, Inslee, then a Congressman, wrote Apollo’s Fire, highlighting stories of Americans’ benefiting from clean energy and calling for a moon-shot-like program to invest in a green economy. These ideas were so popular that Senators Barack Obama and John McCain pushed for green jobs in their 2008 presidential campaigns, and a handful of states have adopted some Green New Deal policies in recent years.\n",
      "In California’s agricultural region, for example, former Fresno mayor Ashley Swearengin, a Republican, initiated a comprehensive plan to establish new transit options and redevelop the local economy while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 40%. The state as a whole has a plan to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity, a vision that’s gaining adherents in cities big and small and in a range of states from New Mexico to New York. “It’s not radical. By no stretch of imagination,” says Kevin de León, a Democrat who spearheaded many of California’s climate initiatives as president pro tempore of the state senate. California’s GDP is larger than that of all but four countries and its economy continues to thrive, he says, dismissing the critique that environmental reform would kill economic growth.\n",
      "Still, the Green New Deal faces pushback not just from the political right but also from labor–a longtime stalwart of the Democratic Party. In early March, the AFL-CIO published a stinging critique of the proposal, calling it unrealistic and a threat to “members’ jobs and their families’ standard of living.” The oil-and-gas industry in particular supports millions of jobs, and while the text of the Green New Deal calls for a “just transition” to other industries, it offers few details. Republicans latched on to a talking point suggesting that the proposal would turn the U.S. Into another Venezuela, pointing to the resolution’s inclusion of a job guarantee and universal health care, goals that many Democrats agree have no place in a climate package.\n",
      "Democrats, of course, are happy to press that question. With the 2020 presidential campaign already under way, candidates are painting themselves as climate warriors. Nearly all of the dozen-plus Democratic hopefuls have endorsed a version of the Green New Deal, touted their environmental cred and described global warming as an existential threat.\n",
      "But activists say most Democratic presidential candidates have a lot of catching up to do: while the party embraces climate science, that’s not the same as proactively fighting to halt dangerous warming. For now, few campaigns are proposing more than restoring Obama-era rules like the Clean Power Plan and recommitting the U.S. To the Paris Agreement.\n",
      "Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has a 99% voting record from the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), has portrayed herself as the policy wonk among the presidential candidates, but she has introduced only one piece of climate legislation in her six years in the Senate, and her office lacks a dedicated climate staffer. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, who both serve on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, have drafted a flurry of bills to deal with everything from toxic chemicals to cleaning up polluted sites, but neither has introduced comprehensive legislation to reduce emissions. Beto O’Rourke has come under fire for taking donations from people in the oil-and-gas industry. Kamala Harris, who joined the Senate in 2017, has a 100% score from the LCV but hasn’t proposed any significant climate legislation.\n",
      "There are exceptions. Sanders, who has a long record of introducing climate legislation big and small in the Senate, plans to unveil a broad environmental plan. It is expected to include massive investment in infrastructure, the elimination of fossil-fuel subsidies and a ban on fossil-fuel extraction on public lands. Inslee and Delaney have both promised big on climate. Inslee says the issue will be a centerpiece of his presidency, while Delaney says a carbon-tax proposal could be enacted in his first 100 days.\n",
      "Behind the scenes, the energy surrounding the Green New Deal debate in D.C. Has pushed top national Democrats to develop a policy that is both ambitious and workable. This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_seq_length`.\n",

      "Question/Instruction: How have major oil-and-gas companies shifted their stance on climate policy, and what role are they playing in shaping legislative solutions?\n",
      "\n",
      "Given material: When a group of more than 20 protesters showed up in the halls of the U.S. Senate on a recent February day, they would have been forgiven for expecting a chilly reception. For the past seven months, sit-ins at a range of offices–from California Governor Jerry Brown’s to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s–had followed a similar pattern: show up, sing songs, get led away in handcuffs for disrupting the peace. But on that particular Wednesday, things were different.\n",
      "It’s not just Democrats who suddenly want to focus on climate change. President Trump seized the opportunity to double down on his denial of climate science, while other Republicans began recalibrating their messaging. Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, an ardent defender of the President who introduced a bill in 2017 to eliminate the EPA, responded to Trump by tweeting, “Climate change is real.” In December, John Cornyn of Texas, who until recently served in GOP Senate leadership, tweeted positively about a tax on carbon emissions, and a month later, Republican Representative Francis Rooney of Florida and Democratic colleagues joined to introduce a carbon-tax measure in the House.\n",
      "This shift has been a long time coming. Scientists have understood for decades that climate change is happening and that humans are causing it; recent studies, including a landmark report in October from the U.N., have shown that things are even worse than we thought. Global temperatures have already risen 1°C since the Industrial Revolution; if the planet heats by much more than an additional half a degree, we could see some of the most catastrophic effects of climate change, including the death of the world’s coral reefs and the inundation of entire island nations.\n",
      "That reality has resonated with the public: more than 70% of Americans now understand that climate change is taking place, according to data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. A February NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey found that two-thirds of Republicans believe their party is “outside the mainstream” on the issue.\n",
      "Into this new political reality came the Green New Deal–equal parts policy proposal and battle cry. The resolution, introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, calls for the U.S. To launch a broad “mobilization” to decarbonize the economy while tackling a slew of other social ills. The response was mixed. People loved it. People loathed it. Others were confused by it. But in D.C., where climate has long been relegated to third-tier status, lawmakers could no longer avoid the issue.\n",
      "Within weeks of the proposal’s release, Democrats competed to burnish their green credentials. Nearly every Democratic candidate for the 2020 presidential nomination has endorsed the Green New Deal. Washington Governor Jay Inslee entered the race on a climate-themed campaign–something unthinkable just a few years ago, when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump didn’t field a single question about climate change in their presidential debates.\n",
      "Some Republicans scrambled to counter what they saw as a liberal threat: if they didn’t come up with a viable climate position, at least one they could point to rhetorically, they risked further ceding the issue to the Democrats, whose proposal they decry as socialist overreach. Behind the scenes, Republicans gathered in working groups trying to grasp for a solution. Major corporations–including in the oil-and-gas industry–pulled out their checkbooks to support conservative climate measures.\n",
      "Love the Green New Deal or hate it, the conversation it has unleashed represents a shift in the discussion surrounding climate policy in the U.S., with ripples that will spread across the globe. The outcome of the debate will go a long way toward determining if humanity can avoid the most catastrophic consequences of a rapidly warming world.\n",
      "Even before Ocasio-Cortez released her Green New Deal resolution, critics had begun to scrutinize the program, using every detail as a chance to condemn it. A congressional newcomer, Ocasio-Cortez has developed a reputation for taking critics and their talking points head-on, but in a recent interview with TIME she rejected the idea that she should have to defend the particulars.\n",
      "“It’s a statement. It’s a vision document. And people want to pick it apart to death,” she says, agreeing with those who liken her proposal to the “bold persistent experimentation” that President Franklin Roosevelt advocated to end the Great Depression. “I hope that we start to get to more of an experimental spirit in government,” she says.\n",
      "Around the same time, Inslee, then a Congressman, wrote Apollo’s Fire, highlighting stories of Americans’ benefiting from clean energy and calling for a moon-shot-like program to invest in a green economy. These ideas were so popular that Senators Barack Obama and John McCain pushed for green jobs in their 2008 presidential campaigns, and a handful of states have adopted some Green New Deal policies in recent years.\n",
      "In California’s agricultural region, for example, former Fresno mayor Ashley Swearengin, a Republican, initiated a comprehensive plan to establish new transit options and redevelop the local economy while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 40%. The state as a whole has a plan to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity, a vision that’s gaining adherents in cities big and small and in a range of states from New Mexico to New York. “It’s not radical. By no stretch of imagination,” says Kevin de León, a Democrat who spearheaded many of California’s climate initiatives as president pro tempore of the state senate. California’s GDP is larger than that of all but four countries and its economy continues to thrive, he says, dismissing the critique that environmental reform would kill economic growth.\n",
      "Still, the Green New Deal faces pushback not just from the political right but also from labor–a longtime stalwart of the Democratic Party. In early March, the AFL-CIO published a stinging critique of the proposal, calling it unrealistic and a threat to “members’ jobs and their families’ standard of living.” The oil-and-gas industry in particular supports millions of jobs, and while the text of the Green New Deal calls for a “just transition” to other industries, it offers few details. Republicans latched on to a talking point suggesting that the proposal would turn the U.S. Into another Venezuela, pointing to the resolution’s inclusion of a job guarantee and universal health care, goals that many Democrats agree have no place in a climate package.\n",
      "Democrats, of course, are happy to press that question. With the 2020 presidential campaign already under way, candidates are painting themselves as climate warriors. Nearly all of the dozen-plus Democratic hopefuls have endorsed a version of the Green New Deal, touted their environmental cred and described global warming as an existential threat.\n",
      "But activists say most Democratic presidential candidates have a lot of catching up to do: while the party embraces climate science, that’s not the same as proactively fighting to halt dangerous warming. For now, few campaigns are proposing more than restoring Obama-era rules like the Clean Power Plan and recommitting the U.S. To the Paris Agreement.\n",
      "Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has a 99% voting record from the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), has portrayed herself as the policy wonk among the presidential candidates, but she has introduced only one piece of climate legislation in her six years in the Senate, and her office lacks a dedicated climate staffer. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, who both serve on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, have drafted a flurry of bills to deal with everything from toxic chemicals to cleaning up polluted sites, but neither has introduced comprehensive legislation to reduce emissions. Beto O’Rourke has come under fire for taking donations from people in the oil-and-gas industry. Kamala Harris, who joined the Senate in 2017, has a 100% score from the LCV but hasn’t proposed any significant climate legislation.\n",
      "There are exceptions. Sanders, who has a long record of introducing climate legislation big and small in the Senate, plans to unveil a broad environmental plan. It is expected to include massive investment in infrastructure, the elimination of fossil-fuel subsidies and a ban on fossil-fuel extraction on public lands. Inslee and Delaney have both promised big on climate. Inslee says the issue will be a centerpiece of his presidency, while Delaney says a carbon-tax proposal could be enacted in his first 100 days.\n",
      "Behind the scenes, the energy surrounding the Green New Deal debate in D.C. Has pushed top national Democrats to develop a policy that is both ambitious and workable. This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_seq_length`.\n",

      "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What steps are governments taking to address the over-representation of Indigenous children in government care? Passage: A family of six lived in this house in Attawapiskat when MP Charlie Angus visited the community. Reserve housing remains substandard in many communities, and children are still being apprehended because of where they live. Image from YouTube. Tens of thousands of Indigenous children are in government care across Canada today, taken from their parents. We don’t know the exact number, because each province and territory collects their own data and there is no national database. But based on available data, Indigenous children are anywhere from five to 12 times more likely to end up in care than non-Indigenous children. Why? Mainly because their families are living in poverty. Most Indigenous children end up in care because their parents are poor, says Nico Trocmé, director of McGill University’s School of Social Work and principal researcher for the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect, a national database that collects information on the characteristics of kids and families who come to child welfare’s attention. The main reason cited for taking Indigenous children away from their family and into government care is neglect. And neglect is another way to describe poverty, Trocmé said. Children are apprehended because their families can’t afford adequate housing, food and clothing for their family. In some cases, parents who lose custody temporarily are then evicted from subsidized housing intended for families, making it even harder to get their children back because they no longer have a suitable place to live. Because of funding cuts, the last Canadian Incidence Study was in 2008, although another study is planned for later this year. Subsequent analysis of national data on child apprehension confirmed the initial findings, Trocmé said. Researchers found First Nations families were twice as likely as non-Indigenous families to be investigated based on a suspicion of physical abuse. “But for neglect they were eight times higher,” he said. Child protection workers were more than four times more likely to launch investigations into First Nations’ families. “And then as they worked their way through the system they’re even more likely to be open for ongoing services, more likely to go to court, and 12 times more likely to be placed in child welfare care,” Trocmé said. The data is not robust enough to be considered nationally representative, he added, but it’s the best Canada has until the next study is completed in 2019. For First Nations kids living on reserve, child welfare services are usually provided by the province. But they’re mainly funded by the federal government. And until February, the federal government would only provide funding after children were taken into care, not to support families or take steps to head off child apprehension. And it has been systematically discriminating against 163,000 First Nations children by refusing to fund services for them at the same rate as non-First Nations children, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled more than two years ago. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development “does more than just ensure the provision of child and family services to First Nations, it controls the provision of those services through its funding mechanisms to the point where it negatively impacts children and families on reserve,” the ruling read. The ruling was clear, but the government largely ignored it — despite five non-compliance orders from the tribunal. Following the fifth order this past January, the February budget included $1.4 billion over the next six years for Indigenous child welfare, on top of the $635 million over five years promised in 2016. But the funding is far short of what’s actually needed to provide First Nations children with the same supports — educational, health and social services as their non-Indigenous peers, says Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society and the driving force behind the effort to take the Canadian government’s treatment of Indigenous children to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal 11 years ago. “I welcome those investments in the budget and I’m thankful to [Indigenous Services] Minister [Jane] Philpott for advocating for them but the reality is these kids are still getting underfunded in early childhood education, in education, in water,” she said. It’s time governments treated Indigenous children the way they treat their non-Indigenous peers, she said. Outcomes for kids placed in the child welfare system aren’t good. A national study from 2015 found almost 60 per cent of homeless youth surveyed had spent time in the child welfare system, while a B.C. Study found just over a third of the kids in care had also been involved in the youth justice system. Kids in care were more likely to be involved with the justice system than to graduate from high school. While there are no federal statistics, youth in care and receiving services from the children’s ministry in B.C. Have alarming rates of death and injuries, with 120 youth dying in 2016 alone according to the provincial watchdog. It’s a number higher than the 104 deaths the ministry counted that year. The provincial Representative for Children and Youth’s office estimates they receive 200 critical injury and death reports for kids in care every month, roughly 85 of which are related to the care they received or failed to receive. Deaths of Indigenous kids, including accidents and suicides, in for-profit group homes in B.C., Alberta and Ontario have also raised alarm in recent years. The federal and B.C. Governments have both committed to implementing the 94 Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the first five of which are about child welfare, as well as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which says that Indigenous people have the right to the shared raising of their own children. After knowing for decades that too many Indigenous children were going into care; federal, provincial and territorial governments are starting to act. Budgets are increasing for on and off-reserve services and the focus — at least in theory — has shifted to supporting families rather than taking children into care. But after 150 years of colonization through child apprehension, Indigenous groups are saying they want to run their own child welfare systems — and they want it now. The issues don’t just affect children and families living on reserves. Even off-reserve Indigenous children — who include status and non-status First Nations, Inuit and Métis children — are being taken into care before families can access services or supports. In Manitoba, where 90 per cent of the 11,000 children in care are Indigenous, First Nations mothers are losing their children within hours of birth. And ironically, one of the factors workers use in assessing whether to apprehend a child is if the mother spent time in government care herself. Manitoba uses a risk assessment tool checklist to determine whether children should be brought into care, a checklist that includes questions about parents’ past and current mental health and addictions issues. B.C. Uses such a tool, too, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Children and Family Development confirmed with The Tyee via email. “Ministry staff and service providers are trained in trauma-informed practice, including trauma caused by inter-generational issues such as those experienced by parents who have themselves been in the child welfare system or who were in residential schools,” they said. With a few exceptions we will examine later in this series, all child welfare agencies in Canada, whether operated by settler or Indigenous governments, must follow the child welfare legislation of the province or territory they are in. Katrine Conroy, B.C. Minister of children and family development, sees the system’s limitations. Current B.C. Legislation prevents social workers from reaching out to First Nations community leaders to find help for families before they go into care, she notes. It’s a rule her ministry is trying to change through Bill 26 introduced last month, which makes amendments to the Child, Family and Community Service Act to allow the director of child welfare to decide if a nation should be contacted. Critics, including the Representative for Children and Youth and several First Nations groups, say the proposed legislation was created without proper consultation with First Nations people and maintains the current paternalistic child welfare system. As it stands the act currently requires every household taking in a child, whether they’re extended family or strangers, must have a separate bedroom for every child. “Well, a grandma wanted to take her two grandsons, and she couldn’t because she didn’t have the spare room,” Conroy said, recalling a specific example she heard recently from a social worker. Minister for less than a year, Conroy admits she was surprised by the extent of the overrepresentation of Indigenous kids in the province’s child welfare system when she took on the job last summer. While Blackstock is not fully satisfied with the federal government’s promised funding and commitments to child welfare reform, she does have hope.

      "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What steps are governments taking to address the over-representation of Indigenous children in government care? Passage: A family of six lived in this house in Attawapiskat when MP Charlie Angus visited the community. Reserve housing remains substandard in many communities, and children are still being apprehended because of where they live. Image from YouTube. Tens of thousands of Indigenous children are in government care across Canada today, taken from their parents. We don’t know the exact number, because each province and territory collects their own data and there is no national database. But based on available data, Indigenous children are anywhere from five to 12 times more likely to end up in care than non-Indigenous children. Why? Mainly because their families are living in poverty. Most Indigenous children end up in care because their parents are poor, says Nico Trocmé, director of McGill University’s School of Social Work and principal researcher for the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect, a national database that collects information on the characteristics of kids and families who come to child welfare’s attention. The main reason cited for taking Indigenous children away from their family and into government care is neglect. And neglect is another way to describe poverty, Trocmé said. Children are apprehended because their families can’t afford adequate housing, food and clothing for their family. In some cases, parents who lose custody temporarily are then evicted from subsidized housing intended for families, making it even harder to get their children back because they no longer have a suitable place to live. Because of funding cuts, the last Canadian Incidence Study was in 2008, although another study is planned for later this year. Subsequent analysis of national data on child apprehension confirmed the initial findings, Trocmé said. Researchers found First Nations families were twice as likely as non-Indigenous families to be investigated based on a suspicion of physical abuse. “But for neglect they were eight times higher,” he said. Child protection workers were more than four times more likely to launch investigations into First Nations’ families. “And then as they worked their way through the system they’re even more likely to be open for ongoing services, more likely to go to court, and 12 times more likely to be placed in child welfare care,” Trocmé said. The data is not robust enough to be considered nationally representative, he added, but it’s the best Canada has until the next study is completed in 2019. For First Nations kids living on reserve, child welfare services are usually provided by the province. But they’re mainly funded by the federal government. And until February, the federal government would only provide funding after children were taken into care, not to support families or take steps to head off child apprehension. And it has been systematically discriminating against 163,000 First Nations children by refusing to fund services for them at the same rate as non-First Nations children, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled more than two years ago. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development “does more than just ensure the provision of child and family services to First Nations, it controls the provision of those services through its funding mechanisms to the point where it negatively impacts children and families on reserve,” the ruling read. The ruling was clear, but the government largely ignored it — despite five non-compliance orders from the tribunal. Following the fifth order this past January, the February budget included $1.4 billion over the next six years for Indigenous child welfare, on top of the $635 million over five years promised in 2016. But the funding is far short of what’s actually needed to provide First Nations children with the same supports — educational, health and social services as their non-Indigenous peers, says Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society and the driving force behind the effort to take the Canadian government’s treatment of Indigenous children to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal 11 years ago. “I welcome those investments in the budget and I’m thankful to [Indigenous Services] Minister [Jane] Philpott for advocating for them but the reality is these kids are still getting underfunded in early childhood education, in education, in water,” she said. It’s time governments treated Indigenous children the way they treat their non-Indigenous peers, she said. Outcomes for kids placed in the child welfare system aren’t good. A national study from 2015 found almost 60 per cent of homeless youth surveyed had spent time in the child welfare system, while a B.C. Study found just over a third of the kids in care had also been involved in the youth justice system. Kids in care were more likely to be involved with the justice system than to graduate from high school. While there are no federal statistics, youth in care and receiving services from the children’s ministry in B.C.

      "\n",
      "Given material: THE VERY IDEA OF a face lift goes against the grain of most architects' thinking. Their instincts lean much more toward all-out plastic surgery, reshaping the body to take on a whole different cast. That is, if they are willing to keep the old body at all. Throwing it out and starting from scratch probably gets closer to their way of doing things.\n",
      "Architects, so the common wisdom goes, want to remake the world, or at least as much of it as they can get their hands on. It's been true enough in the past, but has become less and less so in the last decade, as the architectural profession has been forced to face twin realities: the growing preference in our society both for preserving older buildings and for renovating what we have, rather than starting over again. Renovation is usually, though not always, cheaper than new construction, which makes it especially appealing in an age of monetary constraints. So it is partly a matter of esthetics, partly economics and partly common sense that have brought us here. But we are clearly at a moment when few architects dare to treat a renovation project as if it were a blank slate.\n",
      "A generation ago, architects were taught that their mission was to leave a mark, and often, the stronger the better. New buildings were designed to stand out from their surroundings; renovations of older ones were done so that no one could fail to see the difference between the original and the addition. Even architects whose careers began relatively recently tended to operate this way. Think, for example, of Michael Graves, the Princeton, N.J.-based architect who in the late 1960's and early 70's first came into public view through the striking modernist additions he put onto older houses (which led some colleagues to dub him the ''Cubist kitchen king''). The very point of Graves's additions was to stand apart from the houses to which they were attached. They were highly abstract objects, possessed of far more sophistication than the original houses, and their aloofness was part of the architectural message. ''You are common, but I am something much more special,'' the additions seemed to sneer at the houses.\n",
      "The attitude of Graves's early years was hardly his alone. At the beginning of the 70's, the New York City firm of Mayers & Schiff designed an addition to an old clapboard farmhouse in Connecticut in the form of a two-story-high cedar and glass box. Lest there be any mistake about the transition from new to old, the box was set at a diagonal from the original house and wrapped around one of its corners, the new literally encasing the old.\n",
      "Even Robert A. M. Stern, an architect whose career has soared in the last decade, largely due to his success in reproducing traditional architectural styles, nonetheless felt that he could not afford to let his own work disappear beside that of another architect. At least that is what one major addition he completed in 1981 would suggest. The house is a huge Georgian-style mansion in Llewelyn Park, N.J.; the addition, which contains an indoor pool, is best described as something of an English Baroque pleasure pavilion with a greenhouse roof. And while it picks up a few details from the original house, no one could say it blends in softly.\n",
      "IT IS TEMPTING TO think of the whole issue in terms of ego, given how much, even today, our image of the architect is shaped by such fictitious characters as Howard Roark in the Ayn Rand novel ''The Fountainhead.'' Her architect-hero stands defiantly against bourgeois taste, and would sooner burn his T-square than design a building that took its cues from anyone else's. But for all we might want to see the architect as a romantic hero - for all architects might want to see themselves as such - the truth is that most architecture is shaped by the prevailing taste of an age.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, ego has relatively little to do with it. Indeed, in recent years some of the biggest egos in architecture have begun to do some of the most restrained work. Kevin Roche, who gave us the monumental additions to The Metropolitan Museum of Art in the 70's - wings whose glass and limestone forms contrast sharply with the classical, older sections of the Met - recently designed an addition to the Jewish Museum on Fifth Avenue that is simply an exact reproduction of the museum's original French Gothic mansion. The addition, which will go into construction later this year, is conceived as if to blend new and old into a seamless whole.\n",
      "Similarly, Romaldo Giurgola, a winner of the American Institute of Architects' highest award, has proposed adding to Louis I. Kahn's Kimbell Museum of Art in Fort Worth by literally extending its design at each end. That project hasn't been received as well as the Roche plan, largely because the Kimbell, unlike the Jewish Museum, is considered to be one of the great works of American architecture. Tampering with it at all, even by replicating the original, has been viewed by many critics as akin to adding a few strokes to a Caravaggio.\n",
      "These two examples are extreme ones, of course. Precisely duplicating what has come before is hardly the only mode of the hour, particularly for public buildings. But it is being done more and more. And the fact that architects of Giurgola's stature, or Roche's, would consider replicating sections of older buildings tells us how much architectural values have changed.\n",
      "In the last few years, there has been less hubris in architectural design, less of the arrogant certainty that we can do much better than the architects of earlier generations, and much less of the patronizing attitude toward tradition that for many architects was the motivation for breaking away from the old style when designing a renovation or addition. The original building was there first - a simple fact, but one that today has come to earn it a certain degree of respect. We do not condescend to Georgian or Tudor or Shingle Style houses the way we once did. And we are much more likely now to understand how good the average, traditionally styled American house built before 1940 really is. Architects today know better than to treat it with scorn.\n",
      "MORE THAN INSISTENT originality, we seek a kind of wholeness now, a sense that a building is part of a larger continuity. And if that means the architect is going to be able to express his or her own design sensibility slightly less, we seem to feel that it is a fair trade-off. By the same token, an expanded or renovated house need not look merely like a bigger version of what was there before. But it should take its cues from the original building. Sometimes those cues can be interpreted literally; in other circumstances, it makes more sense to let the original building set a tone, a direction to which the second architect can respond. If architecture can be thought of as a conversation, the new architect entering the house doesn't need to repeat the words of the first architect - but he or she at least ought to be speaking the same language.\n",
      "A couple of recent examples: In Larchmont, N.Y., in 1987, the architects Karen Bausman and Leslie Gill of Bausman-Gill Associates completed a two-story modernist addition to a tiny one-story stucco cottage. To have the extra space they wanted yet still preserve several valued trees on the small plot, the addition had to be two stories tall. Had it imitated the Arts and Crafts style of the cottage, it would have risked overwhelming the original building. But the finished addition appears neither to dominate the cottage nor to be incompatible with it. Bausman-Gill used the same material, stucco, as in the original building and similar steel casement windows, allowing the cottage to initiate the conversation, so to speak. The result is a deft marriage of old and new, the whole being both comfortable and visually richer than either section could be on its own.\n",
      "Similarly, the San Francisco architect Mark Mack took a less literal direction in his addition to a rough-concrete modern house of the 60's, set high in the hills of Berkeley, Calif. Mack's own work has a blunt, almost primitive quality to it, which created a certain compatibility at the outset. But the addition, completed in 1988, stands out sharply from the original building: Its stucco walls are painted a rusty red with indigo-blue trim, and it reads as a powerful sculptural presence on its own. Still, it was not built to stand alone, and doesn't. The addition and the original house strengthen each other, forming a complex and vivid whole. (Mack considered a scheme that was more literally derived from the original house, and left it up to the clients to decide how assertive they This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_seq_length`.\n",

       "{'chosen': \"Title: The Noxious Alliance of Social Media and Extremism: A Threat to Human Progress\\n\\nThe advent of social media platforms has irrevocably revolutionized the way we communicate, share and consume information. While these platforms provide access to information for a global audience and allow individuals to connect regardless of geographical barriers, they have also become a breeding ground for the spread of extremist and violent ideologies, presenting a significant threat to human progress. The pervasiveness of social media, coupled with the anonymity afforded by these platforms, has made it easier for extremists to disseminate their messages, recruit new members, and incite violence against targeted groups, resulting in devastating consequences.\\n\\nExtremist groups often exploit the viral nature of social media to propagate their ideologies. Fast-paced videos, catchy slogans, and emotionally-charged content are a few of the strategies employed by these groups. Swift and aggressive tactics are used to capture the attention of the audience and to stir emotions, especially fear, anger, and hatred. The dissemination of misinformation and conspiracy theories facilitates the spread of extremist ideologies as they exploit the breakdown of trust in traditional media sources. Social media algorithms, designed to show users content that they are likely to engage with, can inadvertently promote more extreme content, further exacerbating visibility.\\n\\nThe Rohingya crisis in Myanmar provides a striking example of the harmful effects of social media promotion on extremism. In 2017, a blitz of Facebook posts filled with false information portrayed the Rohingya, a Muslim minority, as a threat to the predominantly Buddhist country. These posts, often containing graphic images and victim-blaming narratives, led to real-world violence, displacement, and genocide. As noted by the United Nations, social media played a “determining role” in creating hostility towards the Rohingya.\\n\\nThe influence of extremist groups on social media goes beyond victims in the immediate affected region. The diffusion of extremist ideologies online can impact anyone, regardless of geography. Individuals can be targeted and recruited into groups, potentially leading to real-world violence or radicalization. This phenomenon has been observed internationally, from the rise of extremist attacks across Europe to the influence of white supremacist groups in the United States.\\n\\nRadicalization can start with something as innocuous as an online discussion or the sharing of a controversial thread. Individuals vulnerable to extremist ideologies, often seeking answers or meaning in a rapidly changing world, can be drawn into the narratives presented by extremist groups. This further perpetuates social divisions and increases polarization, making it difficult to engage in productive dialogue and find solutions for societal issues.\\n\\nThe fight against the spread of extremist ideologies on social media requires a multifaceted approach, incorporating both technical and policy measures:\\n\\n1. Social Media Platforms' Responsibility: There should be a significant increase in monitoring and regulation by these platforms. Strict policies need to be enforced to prevent the spread of fake news, hate speech, and incitement to violence. Platforms should provide easy mechanisms for users to report harmful content, ensuring swift action in response.\\n\\n2. Education and Awareness: Individuals must be made aware of the tactics used by extremist groups on social media. This can be achieved through educational initiatives in schools and communities that teach about critical thinking, media literacy, and the promotion of respectful discourse.\\n\\n3. Counter-Narratives: Effective counter-narratives that challenge the extremist narratives should be encouraged and shared on these platforms. This can include sharing positive stories of diversity, resilience, and inclusion, showcasing the beauty of global humanity, and aggressively promoting fact-based content.\\n\\n4. Collaboration: Governments, civil society organizations, and tech giants should work together to combat this issue. Governments should enact and enforce laws to prevent the promotion of extremist ideologies online, while tech giants need to take investment, to design more effective algorithms that prioritize content promoting healthy social interactions and factual accuracy.\\n\\n5. Encourage Technology to Fight Extremism: The use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies can be instrumental in detecting and removing harmful content. These systems can analyze patterns in online discourse, flag content worthy of review, and even predict extreme behaviors before they escalate into violent actions.</s>\\n\",\n",
       " 'rejected': '**The Spread of Extremist and Violent Ideologies on Social Media**\\n\\nSocial media platforms have become a powerful tool for spreading extremist and violent ideologies. These platforms provide a way for extremists to connect with like-minded individuals, to spread their messages to a wider audience, and to recruit new members.\\n\\nExtremists use social media in a variety of ways to spread their messages. One common tactic is to create and share content that is designed to appeal to young people. This content often takes the form of memes, videos, and images that are designed to be funny, shocking, or provocative. Extremists also use social media to create echo chambers where they can share their messages without being challenged or criticized. This can make it difficult for people to escape the pull of extremist ideologies.\\n\\nThe spread of extremist and violent ideologies on social media can have a number of negative effects. These ideologies can lead to violence, both online and offline. They can also make it difficult for people to live together peacefully. Additionally, they can undermine democracy and the rule of law.\\n\\nThere are a number of things that can be done to combat the spread of extremist and violent ideologies on social media. One important step is to educate people about the dangers of these ideologies. This education can take place in schools, homes, and communities. It is also important to develop tools that can help to identify and remove extremist content from social media platforms. Additionally, it is important to work to build a more inclusive society that does not tolerate hate and discrimination.\\n\\nThe spread of extremist and violent ideologies on social media is a serious problem. However, there are a number of things that can be done to address this problem. By educating people about the dangers of these ideologies, developing tools to remove extremist content, and working to build a more inclusive society, we can help to prevent the spread of these dangerous ideas.\\n\\nAccording to a study by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, there were over 100,000 active terrorist accounts on Twitter in 2017. These accounts were used to spread propaganda, recruit new members, and incite violence. The study also found that the use of social media by extremists has been on the rise in recent years.\\n\\nOne of the most effective ways that extremists use social media is to create and share content that is designed to appeal to young people. This content often takes the form of memes, videos, and images that are designed to be funny, shocking, or provocative. Extremists use this content to attract attention and to start conversations with young people. Once they have engaged with young people, they can then start to indoctrinate them into their ideology.\\n\\nExtremists also use social media to create echo chambers where they can share their messages without being challenged or criticized. This can make it difficult for people to escape the pull of extremist ideologies. In these echo chambers, extremists can radicalize each other and plan and carry out attacks.\\n\\nThe spread of extremist and violent ideologies on social media can have a number of negative effects. These ideologies can lead to violence, both online and offline. They can also make it difficult for people to live together peacefully. Additionally, they can undermine democracy and the rule of law.\\n\\nThere are a number of things that can be done to combat the spread of extremist and violent ideologies on social media.

      "Dietary choices play a vital role in personal health. It is no secret that the food we consume has a significant impact on our physical and mental well-being. Choosing nutritious food that is full of essential vitamins and minerals, antioxidants, and fiber can help reduce the risk of chronic disease and improve overall health.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most significant benefits of a healthy diet is preventing chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. For instance, research has shown that reducing the intake of saturated fats, red meat or incorporating fish in the diet can reduce the risk of heart disease. This is because a nutritious diet improves blood pressure, lowers cholesterol levels, and reduces inflammation that triggers chronic diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, eating healthy has a positive impact on mental health. Junk food, highly processed foods, and sugary drinks have been linked to deteriorating mental health. A healthy diet comprising vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, majorly plays an essential role in maintaining mental health. The good news is that plant food has been associated with a reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the quality and quantity of food we consume also determine our energy levels daily. The food choices we make have a direct impact on our energy levels, which significantly influences productivity and fitness. Eating highly processed, sugary, or fatty food results in a quick and high spike in blood sugar levels, resulting in a crash that leaves our energy levels low. On the other hand, nutritious food, including fibers and healthy fats, gives us sustained energy levels throughout the day, allowing us to stay productive and energized.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, dietary choices highly impact an individual's physical and mental well-being. A healthy diet can help mitigate the risk of chronic diseases, improve mental health, and stabilize energy levels. It is therefore essential for individuals to make conscious and healthy choices and regularly include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and lean proteins in their diet. Always pay attention to portion sizes, practice mindful eating, and limit processed and sugary foods. A healthy diet is the foundation of a healthy and happier life.</s>\n",

      "1. Monounsaturated fats: These are healthy fats that can help reduce bad cholesterol levels and lower the risk of heart disease. They can be found in foods like avocados, olive oil, nuts, and seeds. To incorporate these healthy fats into your diet, try swapping out your regular cooking oil for olive oil or using avocado in place of butter or margarine on your toast or sandwiches.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Polyunsaturated fats: These are healthy fats that also help reduce bad cholesterol levels and lower the risk of heart disease. They can be found in foods like fatty fish (such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel), flaxseed, walnuts, and chia seeds. To incorporate these healthy fats into your diet, try adding some walnuts or chia seeds to your morning yogurt or oatmeal, and aim to consume fatty fish at least twice a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Omega-3 fatty acids: These are a type of polyunsaturated fat that are particularly beneficial for brain and heart health. They can be found in foods like fatty fish, flaxseed, chia seeds, and walnuts. To incorporate these healthy fats into your diet, try making salmon or tuna salad, sprinkling some ground flaxseed on your cereal or in your smoothies, and adding some crushed walnuts to your salads.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Saturated fats: While saturated fats have long been vilified as unhealthy, recent research suggests that not all saturated fats are created equal. Some sources of saturated fats (such as coconut oil) may have health benefits when consumed in moderation. Other sources of saturated fats (such as processed and fried foods) should be limited. To incorporate healthy sources of saturated fats into your diet, you can try using coconut oil in place of other oils in your cooking, or adding some coconut milk to your smoothies or curries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that while healthy fats are an important part of a balanced diet, they are still a source of calories, so be sure to consume them in moderation. Aim to incorporate a variety of healthy fats into your diet to reap their many health benefits!</s>\n",

      "Write a biting and humorous satire that lampoons the excessive snobbery and self-importance of the contemporary restaurant scene, poking fun at everything from complicated menus and pretentious food descriptions to the haughty attitudes of chefs and servers. Use exaggerated characters, tongue-in-cheek language, and clever irony to skewer the ridiculousness of an industry that takes itself too seriously and alienates customers with its elitist airs. Focus on witty observations and clever parodies of common restaurant tropes, such as foodie culture, farm-to-table trends, and molecular gastronomy. Above all, aim to entertain and amuse with your clever skewering of an all-too familiar target.</s>\n",

      "As the maitre d' led me to my seat at the latest trendy restaurant, he gave me a disdainful glance that made me feel like a peasant showing up to a royal banquet uninvited. With a menu that looked like a Shakespearean soliloquy, I struggled to decipher their pretentious dishes. Was I really expected to know what \"seared monkfish with paprika-infused quinoa and a reduction of foraged elderberries\" tasted like?\n",
      "\n",
      "But never fear, the waiter was there to translate the menu for me, describing each dish with a flourish of arrogance that made me question my own intelligence. \"The sea urchin foam with nitrogen-infused sea grapes and a hint of smoked rosemary is a delicate piece of artistry,\" he pompously proclaimed, ignoring my bewildered expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't help but think: why does eating out have to be such a highbrow experience? Why can't I just order a good old-fashioned burger without feeling like a culinary philistine? This obsession with obscure, locally-sourced ingredients and molecular gastronomy techniques is alienating and ridiculous.\n",

      "\"Oh, you don't like truffle oil? Clearly, your unsophisticated palate can't handle refined flavors,\" snorted the chef, his nose in the air.\n",

Suddenly, every restaurant worth its salt (or fleur de sel) has to have its own organic garden, and the waitstaff all have to don plaid shirts and suspenders like they've just come back from a day's manual labor on the farm. But are we really supposed to believe that those heirloom tomatoes were grown just for us, and not to fulfill the restaurant's Instagram aesthetic?\n",

      "\n",
      "- \"Our chef's special molecular gastronomy creation is a feast for the senses - edible flowers burst with flavor in your mouth, while the liquid nitrogen-infused foam washes over your palate. It's like experiencing the Big Bang in your mouth.\" Translation: We're using science to make food taste weird because we're bored.\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"We source our artisanal honey from a beekeeper who personally sings to each hive to ensure optimum honey production. You can taste the love and care in every spoonful.\" Translation: We're trying really hard to make something as basic as honey sound special.\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"Our farm-to-table experience means that every dish is infused with the essence of the land. From the misty mornings to the gentle breezes, every flavor profile tells a story of our region's terroir.\" Translation: We're just trying to impress you with fancy words, but really we just ordered our produce from a local farmer.\n",

      "Examine the various ways in which political patronage has affected the quality and effectiveness of public services, including but not limited to issues related to accountability, efficiency, and democratic governance. Consider the historical and contemporary contexts in which patronage has operated, and assess the potential outcomes of different policy interventions aimed at minimizing its negative effects. Back up your analysis with empirical evidence, case studies, and relevant research literature.</s> \n",
      "<|assistant|>\n",
      "Political patronage is the practice of awarding individuals with government jobs or contracts solely based on their political affiliation or support for politicians in power. This practice has permeated various aspects of public service delivery and had significant consequences on the quality and effectiveness of these services, undermining accountability, efficiency, and democratic governance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, political patronage has been pervasive in many countries, including the United States. For instance, in the 19th century, political bosses in major cities used patronage to build political machines that controlled local politics and used public resources to reward their supporters. In contemporary times, political patronage continues to be prevalent in many developing and developed countries, with politicians frequently using public resources to reward their supporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main ways in which political patronage affects public services is by undermining accountability. When political considerations and loyalty are the basis for hiring or awarding contracts, the best-qualified candidates or companies may be overlooked in favor of less competent but politically connected actors. This undermines meritocracy and creates a culture of impunity among politicians and public officials, which erodes public trust in the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, political patronage can also reduce efficiency by impeding the implementation of policies that could benefit the general public. Politicians often prioritize projects and policies that appease their supporters over those that may have more significant benefits for the public at large, which can lead to wasteful spending and a lack of progress on critical issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, political patronage can have adverse consequences for democratic governance. When politicians use public resources to reward their supporters, they create a cycle of corruption and a culture of dependency that undermines the legitimacy of democratic institutions. This can lead to widespread disillusionment and a lack of faith in the ability of democratic institutions to deliver for the greater good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several policy interventions can help to minimize the negative effects of political patronage. The implementation of robust anti-corruption mechanisms, such as creating an independent audit office, strengthening whistleblower protections, and enhancing transparency in the procurement process, can help to mitigate corruption risks. Improved civil service reform, such as merit-based hiring, tenure, and performance-based evaluations, could ensure that public service delivery is not influenced by political considerations. Finally, institutional changes, such as creating stronger checks and balances, can also help to reduce the influence of political patronage on public service delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Empirical evidence and research literature demonstrate the negative effects of political patronage on public service delivery. For instance, a study of public procurement in India found that political interference and patronage led to low-quality infrastructure and higher procurement costs. Similarly, a World Bank study found that political patronage was a significant barrier to effective public service delivery in Kenya.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, political patronage has significant consequences for the quality and effectiveness of public services, including but not limited to issues related to accountability, efficiency, and democratic governance. The adoption of robust anti-corruption mechanisms, civil service reform, and institutional changes can mitigate the adverse effects of political patronage, promote public trust in democratic institutions, and help to deliver better public services.</s> \n",

      "Thank you for providing a comprehensive analysis of political patronage and its effect on public service delivery. I would like to know more about the role of civil society in fighting against political patronage. Can you please provide more information and examples of how civil society can help minimize the negative effects of political patronage on public services?</s> \n",
      "<|assistant|>\n",
      "Certainly! Civil society plays a crucial role in fighting against political patronage and promoting good governance. Here are some examples of how civil society can help minimize the negative effects of political patronage on public services:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Advocacy and Awareness-raising: Civil society organizations can play a vital role in raising awareness about the negative effects of political patronage on public services. They can generate public pressure on the authorities to carry out reforms aimed at reducing political interference in the hiring process and procurement. Civil society groups can also educate citizens on their role in monitoring public service delivery and exposing corrupt practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Monitoring and Oversight: Civil society organizations can undertake independent monitoring and evaluation of public services, identify areas where patronage is being practiced, and provide evidence of such practices to the authorities. This leads to accountability and transparency in decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Building Capacities of communities to Monitor Public Services: Civil society organizations can help communities develop and implement mechanisms for monitoring public service delivery, including tracking the distribution of public resources and oversight of infrastructure projects. This makes it difficult for politicians and their proxies to engage in patronage practices without being detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Mobilization of Citizens: Civil society organizations can mobilize citizens to demand accountability and transparency in the allocation of public resources. They can also engage stakeholders across the political spectrum in advocating for reforms aimed at reducing political patronage in public service delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some examples of successful civil society interventions against political patronage include the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Zero Tolerance Campaign for Public Service Corruption in Malawi, which involved civil society organizations and faith-based groups campaigning for transparency, accountability, and meritocracy in the recruitment of public officials in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Citizens' Monitoring of Public Procurement campaign in the Philippines, which involved civil society organizations and the media working together to monitor public procurement processes and scrutinizing projects funded by the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Provision of Social Services by the Ugandan Government study, which included civil society organizations and local communities in monitoring the delivery of public services. \n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, civil society can play a crucial role in reducing the negative effects of political patronage on public services. By advocating for good governance, monitoring and oversight, building community capacities to monitor public services, and mobilizing citizens, civil society can contribute to making public service delivery more efficient, fair, and accountable.</s> \n",

      "Thank you for your response on the role of civil society in the fight against political patronage. Your insights have been very helpful. However, I would like you to provide more examples of successful civil society interventions against political patronage in Africa. Can you please share more on this?</s> \n",
      "<|assistant|>\n",
      "Certainly! Here are some additional examples of successful civil society interventions against political patronage in Africa:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Citizens' Budget Initiative (CBI) in Kenya: This project involves civil society organizations and citizen groups working to improve transparency and accountability in the budget process. The CBI has developed tools and training materials to help citizens understand government budgets and monitor the allocation of resources. Through the CBI, citizen groups have been able to engage with policymakers and scrutinize public expenditure to ensure that it is in line with public needs and priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The FixMyCommunity Platform in Nigeria: This platform, developed by the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), allows citizens to report instances of corruption and poor service delivery in their communities. The platform has been able to track the delivery of public services such as road repairs, sanitation, and healthcare in several Nigerian cities, leading to improved service delivery and reduced corruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The Mahali Center for Good Governance and Civic Engagement in Tanzania: This center works to promote good governance, accountability, and civic participation in Tanzania. The Mahali Center has been instrumental in promoting the use of social accountability tools such as participatory budgeting and community scorecards to monitor public services and hold officials accountable.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The Social Accountability Monitoring in Mozambique Project: This project, implemented by the Centre for Public Integrity (CIP), is a network of civil society organizations, journalists, and community members working to promote transparency and accountability in public procurement in Mozambique. The project has been able to expose instances of corruption and influence policy reforms aimed at reducing patronage in public procurement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all of these cases, civil society organizations have been able to successfully challenge political patronage by promoting transparency, accountability, and citizens' active participation in the governance process. These interventions have led to improved service delivery, reduced corruption, and enhanced public trust in democratic institutions.</s> \n",
